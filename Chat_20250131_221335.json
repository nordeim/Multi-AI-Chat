A good deal of rich\ngarden soil was attached to her strong brogue shoes and a\nfew fragments of earth were adhering to her nose, but of\nthat fact she was perfectly unconscious.\nShe had a slight struggle in opening the vicarage gate\nwhich hung, rustily, half o\ufb00 its hinges. A pu\ufb00 of wind caught\nat her battered felt hat, causing it to sit even more rakishly\nthan it had done before. \u2018Bother!\u2019 said Bunch.\nChristened by her optimistic parents Diana, Mrs Harmon\nhad become Bunch at an early age for somewhat obvious\nreasons and the name had stuck to her ever since.\nClutching the chrysanthemums, she made her way through\nthe gate to the churchyard, and so to the church door.\nThe November air was mild and damp. Clouds scudded\nacross the sky with patches of blue here and there. Inside,\nthe church was dark and cold; it was unheated except at\nservice times.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Brrrrrh!\u2019 said Bunch expressively. \u2018I\u2019d better get on with\nthis quickly. I don\u2019t want to die of cold.\u2019\nWith the quickness born of practice she collected the\nnecessary paraphernalia: vases, water, \ufb02ower-holders. \u2018I\nwish we had lilies,\u2019 thought Bunch to herself. \u2018I get so tired\nof these scraggy chrysanthemums.\u2019 Her nimble \ufb01ngers\narranged the blooms in their holders.\nThere was nothing particularly original or artistic about\nthe decorations, for Bunch Harmon herself was neither\noriginal nor artistic, but it was a homely and pleasant\narrangement. Carrying the vases carefully, Bunch stepped\nup the aisle and made her way towards the altar. As she did\nso the sun came out.\nIt shone through the east window of somewhat crude\ncoloured glass, mostly blue and red\u2014the gift of a wealthy\nVictorian churchgoer. The e\ufb00ect was almost startling in its\nsudden opulence. \u2018Like jewels,\u2019 thought Bunch. Suddenly\nshe stopped, staring ahead of her. On the chancel steps was\na huddled dark form.\nPutting down the \ufb02owers carefully, Bunch went up to it\nand bent over it. It was a man lying there, huddled over on\nhimself. Bunch knelt down by him and slowly, carefully, she\nturned him over. Her \ufb01ngers went to his pulse\u2014a pulse so\nfeeble and \ufb02uttering that it told its own story, as did the\nalmost greenish pallor of his face. There was no doubt,\nBunch thought, that the man was dying.\nHe was a man of about forty-\ufb01ve, dressed in a dark,\nshabby suit. She laid down the limp hand she had picked up\nand looked at his other hand. This seemed clenched like a\n\ufb01st on his breast. Looking more closely she saw that the\n\ufb01ngers were closed over what seemed to be a large wad or\n\n----Page Break----\nhandkerchief which he was holding tightly to his chest. All\nround the clenched hand there were splashes of a dry brown\n\ufb02uid which, Bunch guessed, was dry blood. Bunch sat back\non her heels, frowning.\nUp till now the man\u2019s eyes had been closed but at this\npoint they suddenly opened and \ufb01xed themselves on\nBunch\u2019s face. They were neither dazed nor wandering. They\nseemed fully alive and intelligent. His lips moved, and\nBunch bent forward to catch the words, or rather the word.\nIt was only one word that he said:\n\u2018Sanctuary.\u2019\nThere was, she thought, just a very faint smile as he\nbreathed out this word. There was no mistaking it, for after\na moment he said it again, \u2018Sanctuary\u2026\u2019\nThen, with a faint, long-drawn-out sigh, his eyes closed\nagain. Once more Bunch\u2019s \ufb01ngers went to his pulse. It was\nstill there, but fainter now and more intermittent. She got up\nwith decision.\n\u2018Don\u2019t move,\u2019 she said, \u2018or try to move. I\u2019m going for\nhelp.\u2019\nThe man\u2019s eyes opened again but he seemed now to be\n\ufb01xing his attention on the coloured light that came through\nthe east window. He murmured something that Bunch could\nnot quite catch. She thought, startled, that it might have\nbeen her husband\u2019s name.\n\u2018Julian?\u2019 she said. \u2018Did you come here to \ufb01nd Julian?\u2019 But\nthere was no answer. The man lay with eyes closed, his\nbreathing coming in slow, shallow fashion.\n\n----Page Break----\nBunch turned and left the church rapidly. She glanced at\nher watch and nodded with some satisfaction. Dr Gri\ufb03ths\nwould still be in his surgery. It was only a couple of minutes\u2019\nwalk from the church. She went in, without waiting to knock\nor ring, passing through the waiting room and into the\ndoctor\u2019s surgery.\n\u2018You must come at once,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018There\u2019s a man\ndying in the church.\u2019\nSome minutes later Dr Gri\ufb03ths rose from his knees after\na brief examination.\n\u2018Can we move him from here into the vicarage? I can\nattend to him better there\u2014not that it\u2019s any use.\u2019\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018I\u2019ll go along and get things\nready. I\u2019ll get Harper and Jones, shall I? To help you carry\nhim.\u2019\n\u2018Thanks. I can telephone from the vicarage for an\nambulance, but I\u2019m afraid\u2014by the time it comes\u2026\u2019 He left\nthe remark un\ufb01nished.\nBunch said, \u2018Internal bleeding?\u2019\nDr Gri\ufb03ths nodded. He said, \u2018How on earth did he come\nhere?\u2019\n\u2018I think he must have been here all night,\u2019 said Bunch,\nconsidering. \u2018Harper unlocks the church in the morning as\nhe goes to work, but he doesn\u2019t usually come in.\u2019\nIt was about \ufb01ve minutes later when Dr Gri\ufb03ths put\ndown the telephone receiver and came back into the\nmorning-room where the injured man was lying on quickly\n\n----Page Break----\narranged blankets on the sofa. Bunch was moving a basin of\nwater and clearing up after the doctor\u2019s examination.\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s that,\u2019 said Gri\ufb03ths. \u2018I\u2019ve sent for an\nambulance and I\u2019ve noti\ufb01ed the police.\u2019 He stood, frowning,\nlooking down on the patient who lay with closed eyes. His\nleft hand was plucking in a nervous, spasmodic way at his\nside.\n\u2018He was shot,\u2019 said Gri\ufb03ths. \u2018Shot at fairly close quarters.\nHe rolled his handkerchief up into a ball and plugged the\nwound with it so as to stop the bleeding.\u2019\n\u2018Could he have gone far after that happened?\u2019 Bunch\nasked.\n\u2018Oh, yes, it\u2019s quite possible. A mortally wounded man has\nbeen known to pick himself up and walk along a street as\nthough nothing had happened, and then suddenly collapse\n\ufb01ve or ten minutes later. So he needn\u2019t have been shot in\nthe church. Oh no. He may have been shot some distance\naway. Of course, he may have shot himself and then\ndropped the revolver and staggered blindly towards the\nchurch. I don\u2019t quite know why he made for the church and\nnot for the vicarage.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, I know that,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018He said it: \u201cSanctuary.\u201d \u2019\nThe doctor stared at her. \u2018Sanctuary?\u2019\n\u2018Here\u2019s Julian,\u2019 said Bunch, turning her head as she heard\nher husband\u2019s steps in the hall. \u2018Julian! Come here.\u2019\nThe Reverend Julian Harmon entered the room. His\nvague, scholarly manner always made him appear much\nolder than he really was. \u2018Dear me!\u2019 said Julian Harmon,\n\n----Page Break----\nstaring in a mild, puzzled manner at the surgical appliances\nand the prone \ufb01gure on the sofa.\nBunch explained with her usual economy of words. \u2018He\nwas in the church, dying. He\u2019d been shot. Do you know him,\nJulian? I thought he said your name.\u2019\nThe vicar came up to the sofa and looked down at the\ndying man. \u2018Poor fellow,\u2019 he said, and shook his head. \u2018No, I\ndon\u2019t know him. I\u2019m almost sure I\u2019ve never seen him\nbefore.\u2019\nAt that moment the dying man\u2019s eyes opened once\nmore. They went from the doctor to Julian Harmon and from\nhim to his wife. The eyes stayed there, staring into Bunch\u2019s\nface. Gri\ufb03ths stepped forward.\n\u2018If you could tell us,\u2019 he said urgently.\nBut with eyes \ufb01xed on Bunch, the man said in a weak\nvoice, \u2018Please\u2014please\u2014\u2019 And then, with a slight tremor, he\ndied\u2026\nSergeant Hayes licked his pencil and turned the page of\nhis notebook.\n\u2018So that\u2019s all you can tell me, Mrs Harmon?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s all,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018These are the things out of his\ncoat pockets.\u2019\nOn a table at Sergeant Hayes\u2019s elbow was a wallet, a\nrather battered old watch with the initials W.S. and the\nreturn half of a ticket to London. Nothing more.\n\u2018You\u2019ve found out who he is?\u2019 asked Bunch.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018A Mr and Mrs Eccles phoned up the station. He\u2019s her\nbrother, it seems. Name of Sandbourne. Been in a low state\nof health and nerves for some time. He\u2019s been getting worse\nlately. The day before yesterday he walked out and didn\u2019t\ncome back. He took a revolver with him.\u2019\n\u2018And he came out here and shot himself with it?\u2019 said\nBunch. \u2018Why?\u2019\n\u2018Well, you see, he\u2019d been depressed\u2026\u2019\nBunch interrupted him. \u2018I don\u2019t mean that. I mean, why\nhere?\u2019\nSince Sergeant Hayes obviously did not know the answer\nto that one, he replied in an oblique fashion, \u2018Come out\nhere, he did, on the \ufb01ve-ten bus.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bunch again. \u2018But why?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know, Mrs Harmon,\u2019 said Sergeant Hayes.\n\u2018There\u2019s no accounting. If the balance of the mind is\ndisturbed\u2014\u2019\nBunch \ufb01nished for him. \u2018They may do it anywhere. But it\nstill seems to me unnecessary to take a bus out to a small\ncountry place like this. He didn\u2019t know anyone here, did he?\u2019\n\u2018Not so far as can be ascertained,\u2019 said Sergeant Hayes.\nHe coughed in an apologetic manner and said, as he rose to\nhis feet, \u2018It may be as Mr and Mrs Eccles will come out and\nsee you, ma\u2019am\u2014if you don\u2019t mind, that is.\u2019\n\u2018Of course I don\u2019t mind,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018It\u2019s very natural. I\nonly wish I had something to tell them.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll be getting along,\u2019 said Sergeant Hayes.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m only so thankful,\u2019 said Bunch, going with him to the\nfront door, \u2018that it wasn\u2019t murder.\u2019\nA car had driven up at the vicarage gate. Sergeant\nHayes, glancing at it, remarked: \u2018Looks as though that\u2019s Mr\nand Mrs Eccles come here now, ma\u2019am, to talk with you.\u2019\nBunch braced herself to endure what, she felt, might be\nrather a di\ufb03cult ordeal. \u2018However,\u2019 she thought, \u2018I can\nalways call Julian to help me. A clergyman\u2019s a great help\nwhen people are bereaved.\u2019\nExactly what she had expected Mr and Mrs Eccles to be\nlike, Bunch could not have said, but she was conscious, as\nshe greeted them, of a feeling of surprise. Mr Eccles was a\nstout \ufb02orid man whose natural manner would have been\ncheerful and facetious. Mrs Eccles had a vaguely \ufb02ashy look\nabout her. She had a small, mean, pursed-up mouth. Her\nvoice was thin and reedy.\n\u2018It\u2019s been a terrible shock, Mrs Harmon, as you can\nimagine,\u2019 she said.\n\u2018Oh, I know,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018It must have been. Do sit\ndown. Can I o\ufb00er you\u2014well, perhaps it\u2019s a little early for tea\n\u2014\u2019\nMr Eccles waved a pudgy hand. \u2018No, no, nothing for us,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018It\u2019s very kind of you, I\u2019m sure. Just wanted to\u2026\nwell\u2026what poor William said and all that, you know?\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s been abroad a long time,\u2019 said Mrs Eccles, \u2018and I\nthink he must have had some very nasty experiences. Very\nquiet and depressed he\u2019s been, ever since he came home.\nSaid the world wasn\u2019t \ufb01t to live in and there was nothing to\nlook forward to. Poor Bill, he was always moody.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nBunch stared at them both for a moment or two without\nspeaking.\n\u2018Pinched my husband\u2019s revolver, he did,\u2019 went on Mrs\nEccles. \u2018Without our knowing. Then it seems he come here\nby bus. I suppose that was nice feeling on his part. He\nwouldn\u2019t have liked to do it in our house.\u2019\n\u2018Poor fellow, poor fellow,\u2019 said Mr Eccles, with a sigh. \u2018It\ndoesn\u2019t do to judge.\u2019\nThere was another short pause, and Mr Eccles said, \u2018Did\nhe leave a message? Any last words, nothing like that?\u2019\nHis bright, rather pig-like eyes watched Bunch closely.\nMrs Eccles, too, leaned forward as though anxious for the\nreply.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Bunch quietly. \u2018He came into the church when\nhe was dying, for sanctuary.\u2019\nMrs Eccles said in a puzzled voice. \u2018Sanctuary? I don\u2019t\nthink I quite\u2026\u2019\nMr Eccles interrupted. \u2018Holy place, my dear,\u2019 he said\nimpatiently. \u2018That\u2019s what the vicar\u2019s wife means. It\u2019s a sin\u2014\nsuicide, you know. I expect he wanted to make amends.\u2019\n\u2018He tried to say something just before he died,\u2019 said\nBunch. \u2018He began, \u201cPlease,\u201d but that\u2019s as far as he got.\u2019\nMrs Eccles put her handkerchief to her eyes and sni\ufb00ed.\n\u2018Oh, dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s terribly upsetting, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\u2018There, there, Pam,\u2019 said her husband. \u2018Don\u2019t take on.\nThese things can\u2019t be helped. Poor Willie. Still, he\u2019s at peace\nnow. Well, thank you very much, Mrs Harmon. I hope we\n\n----Page Break----\nhaven\u2019t interrupted you. A vicar\u2019s wife is a busy lady, we\nknow that.\u2019\nThey shook hands with her. Then Eccles turned back\nsuddenly to say, \u2018Oh yes, there\u2019s just one other thing. I think\nyou\u2019ve got his coat here, haven\u2019t you?\u2019\n\u2018His coat?\u2019 Bunch frowned.\nMrs Eccles said, \u2018We\u2019d like all his things, you know.\nSentimental-like.\u2019\n\u2018He had a watch and a wallet and a railway ticket in the\npockets,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018I gave them to Sergeant Hayes.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s all right, then,\u2019 said Mr Eccles. \u2018He\u2019ll hand them\nover to us, I expect. His private papers would be in the\nwallet.\u2019\n\u2018There was a pound note in the wallet,\u2019 said Bunch.\n\u2018Nothing else.\u2019\n\u2018No letters? Nothing like that?\u2019\nBunch shook her head.\n\u2018Well, thank you again, Mrs Harmon. The coat he was\nwearing\u2014perhaps the sergeant\u2019s got that too, has he?\u2019\nBunch frowned in an e\ufb00ort of remembrance.\n\u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018I don\u2019t think\u2026let me see. The doctor and I\ntook his coat o\ufb00 to examine his wound.\u2019 She looked round\nthe room vaguely. \u2018I must have taken it upstairs with the\ntowels and basin.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder now, Mrs Harmon, if you don\u2019t mind\u2026We\u2019d like\nhis coat, you know, the last thing he wore. Well, the wife\n\n----Page Break----\nfeels rather sentimental about it.\u2019\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Would you like me to have it\ncleaned \ufb01rst? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s rather\u2014well\u2014stained.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, no, no, that doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\nBunch frowned. \u2018Now I wonder where\u2026excuse me a\nmoment.\u2019 She went upstairs and it was some few minutes\nbefore she returned.\n\u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 she said breathlessly, \u2018my daily woman\nmust have put it aside with other clothes that were going to\nthe cleaners. It\u2019s taken me quite a long time to \ufb01nd it. Here\nit is. I\u2019ll do it up for you in brown paper.\u2019\nDisclaiming their protests she did so; then once more\ne\ufb00usively bidding her farewell the Eccleses departed.\nBunch went slowly back across the hall and entered the\nstudy. The Reverend Julian Harmon looked up and his brow\ncleared. He was composing a sermon and was fearing that\nhe\u2019d been led astray by the interest of the political relations\nbetween Judaea and Persia, in the reign of Cyrus.\n\u2018Yes, dear?\u2019 he said hopefully.\n\u2018Julian,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018What\u2019s Sanctuary exactly?\u2019\nJulian Harmon gratefully put aside his sermon paper.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 he said. \u2018Sanctuary in Roman and Greek temples\napplied to the cella in which stood the statue of a god. The\nLatin word for altar \u201cara\u201d also means protection.\u2019 He\ncontinued learnedly: \u2018In three hundred and ninety-nine A.D.\nthe right of sanctuary in Christian churches was \ufb01nally and\nde\ufb01nitely recognized. The earliest mention of the right of\n\n----Page Break----\nsanctuary in England is in the Code of Laws issued by\nEthelbert in A.D. six hundred\u2026\u2019\nHe continued for some time with his exposition but was,\nas often, disconcerted by his wife\u2019s reception of his erudite\npronouncement.\n\u2018Darling,\u2019 she said. \u2018You are sweet.\u2019\nBending over, she kissed him on the tip of his nose. Julian\nfelt rather like a dog who has been congratulated on\nperforming a clever trick.\n\u2018The Eccleses have been here,\u2019 said Bunch.\nThe vicar frowned. \u2018The Eccleses? I don\u2019t seem to\nremember\u2026\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t know them. They\u2019re the sister and her\nhusband of the man in the church.\u2019\n\u2018My dear, you ought to have called me.\u2019\n\u2018There wasn\u2019t any need,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018They were not in\nneed of consolation. I wonder now\u2026\u2019 She frowned. \u2018If I put a\ncasserole in the oven tomorrow, can you manage, Julian? I\nthink I shall go up to London for the sales.\u2019\n\u2018The sails?\u2019 Her husband looked at her blankly. \u2018Do you\nmean a yacht or a boat or something?\u2019\nBunch laughed. \u2018No, darling. There\u2019s a special white sale\nat Burrows and Portman\u2019s. You know, sheets, table cloths\nand towels and glass-cloths. I don\u2019t know what we do with\nour glass-cloths, the way they wear through. Besides,\u2019 she\nadded thoughtfully, \u2018I think I ought to go and see Aunt Jane.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nII\nThat sweet old lady, Miss Jane Marple, was enjoying the\ndelights of the metropolis for a fortnight, comfortably\ninstalled in her nephew\u2019s studio \ufb02at.\n\u2018So kind of dear Raymond,\u2019 she murmured. \u2018He and Joan\nhave gone to America for a fortnight and they insisted I\nshould come up here and enjoy myself. And now, dear\nBunch, do tell me what it is that\u2019s worrying you.\u2019\nBunch was Miss Marple\u2019s favourite godchild, and the old\nlady looked at her with great a\ufb00ection as Bunch, thrusting\nher best felt hat farther on the back of her head, started her\nstory.\nBunch\u2019s recital was concise and clear. Miss Marple\nnodded her head as Bunch \ufb01nished. \u2018I see,\u2019 she said. \u2018Yes, I\nsee.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s why I felt I had to see you,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018You see,\nnot being clever\u2014\u2019\n\u2018But you are clever, my dear.\u2019\n\u2018No, I\u2019m not. Not clever like Julian.\u2019\n\u2018Julian, of course, has a very solid intellect,\u2019 said Miss\nMarple.\n\u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Julian\u2019s got the intellect, but on\nthe other hand, I\u2019ve got the sense.\u2019\n\u2018You have a lot of common sense, Bunch, and you\u2019re very\nintelligent.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You see, I don\u2019t really know what I ought to do. I can\u2019t\nask Julian because\u2014well, I mean, Julian\u2019s so full of\nrectitude\u2026\u2019\nThis statement appeared to be perfectly understood by\nMiss Marple, who said, \u2018I know what you mean, dear. We\nwomen\u2014well, it\u2019s di\ufb00erent.\u2019 She went on. \u2018You told me what\nhappened, Bunch, but I\u2019d like to know \ufb01rst exactly what you\nthink.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s all wrong,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018The man who was there in\nthe church, dying, knew all about Sanctuary. He said it just\nthe way Julian would have said it. I mean, he was a well-\nread, educated man. And if he\u2019d shot himself, he wouldn\u2019t\ndrag himself to a church afterwards and say \u201csanctuary\u201d.\nSanctuary means that you\u2019re pursued, and when you get\ninto a church you\u2019re safe. Your pursuers can\u2019t touch you. At\none time even the law couldn\u2019t get at you.\u2019\nShe looked questioningly at Miss Marple. The latter\nnodded. Bunch went on, \u2018Those people, the Eccleses, were\nquite di\ufb00erent. Ignorant and coarse. And there\u2019s another\nthing. That watch\u2014the dead man\u2019s watch. It had the initials\nW.S. on the back of it. But inside\u2014I opened it\u2014in very small\nlettering there was \u201cTo Walter from his father\u201d and a date.\nWalter. But the Eccleses kept talking of him as William or\nBill.\u2019\nMiss Marple seemed about to speak but Bunch rushed\non. \u2018Oh, I know you\u2019re not always called the name you\u2019re\nbaptized by. I mean, I can understand that you might be\nchristened William and called \u201cPorgy\u201d or \u201cCarrots\u201d or\nsomething. But your sister wouldn\u2019t call you William or Bill if\nyour name was Walter.\u2019\n\u2018You mean that she wasn\u2019t his sister?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m quite sure she wasn\u2019t his sister. They were horrid\u2014\nboth of them. They came to the vicarage to get his things\nand to \ufb01nd out if he\u2019d said anything before he died. When I\nsaid he hadn\u2019t I saw it in their faces\u2014relief. I think myself,\u2019\n\ufb01nished Bunch, \u2018it was Eccles who shot him.\u2019\n\u2018Murder?\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Murder. That\u2019s why I came to you,\ndarling.\u2019\nBunch\u2019s remark might have seemed incongruous to an\nignorant listener, but in certain spheres Miss Marple had a\nreputation for dealing with murder.\n\u2018He said \u201cplease\u201d to me before he died,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018He\nwanted me to do something for him. The awful thing is I\u2019ve\nno idea what.\u2019\nMiss Marple considered for a moment or two, and then\npounced on the point that had already occurred to Bunch.\n\u2018But why was he there at all?\u2019 she asked.\n\u2018You mean,\u2019 said Bunch, \u2018if you wanted sanctuary you\nmight pop into a church anywhere. There\u2019s no need to take\na bus that only goes four times a day and come out to a\nlonely spot like ours for it.\u2019\n\u2018He must have come there for a purpose,\u2019 Miss Marple\nthought. \u2018He must have come to see someone. Chipping\nCleghorn\u2019s not a big place, Bunch. Surely you must have\nsome idea of who it was he came to see?\u2019\nBunch reviewed the inhabitants of her village in her mind\nbefore rather doubtfully shaking her head. \u2018In a way,\u2019 she\nsaid, \u2018it could be anybody.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018He never mentioned a name?\u2019\n\u2018He said Julian, or I thought he said Julian. It might have\nbeen Julia, I suppose. As far as I know, there isn\u2019t any Julia\nliving in Chipping Cleghorn.\u2019\nShe screwed up her eyes as she thought back to the\nscene. The man lying there on the chancel steps, the light\ncoming through the window with its jewels of red and blue\nlight.\n\u2018Jewels,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully.\n\u2018I\u2019m coming now,\u2019 said Bunch, \u2018to the most important\nthing of all. The reason why I\u2019ve really come here today. You\nsee, the Eccleses made a great fuss about having his coat.\nWe took it o\ufb00 when the doctor was seeing him. It was an\nold, shabby sort of coat\u2014there was no reason they should\nhave wanted it. They pretended it was sentimental, but that\nwas nonsense.\n\u2018Anyway, I went up to \ufb01nd it, and as I was just going up\nthe stairs I remembered how he\u2019d made a kind of picking\ngesture with his hand, as though he was fumbling with the\ncoat. So when I got hold of the coat I looked at it very\ncarefully and I saw that in one place the lining had been\nsewn up again with a di\ufb00erent thread. So I unpicked it and I\nfound a little piece of paper inside. I took it out and I sewed\nit up again properly with thread that matched. I was careful\nand I don\u2019t really think that the Eccleses would know I\u2019ve\ndone it. I don\u2019t think so, but I can\u2019t be sure. And I took the\ncoat down to them and made some excuse for the delay.\u2019\n\u2018The piece of paper?\u2019 asked Miss Marple.\nBunch opened her handbag. \u2018I didn\u2019t show it to Julian,\u2019\nshe said, \u2018because he would have said that I ought to have\n\n----Page Break----\ngiven it to the Eccleses. But I thought I\u2019d rather bring it to\nyou instead.\u2019\n\u2018A cloakroom ticket,\u2019 said Miss Marple, looking at it.\n\u2018Paddington Station.\u2019\n\u2018He had a return ticket to Paddington in his pocket,\u2019 said\nBunch.\nThe eyes of the two women met.\n\u2018This calls for action,\u2019 said Miss Marple briskly. \u2018But it\nwould be advisable, I think, to be careful. Would you have\nnoticed at all, Bunch dear, whether you were followed when\nyou came to London today?\u2019\n\u2018Followed!\u2019 exclaimed Bunch. \u2018You don\u2019t think\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Well, I think it\u2019s possible,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018When\nanything is possible, I think we ought to take precautions.\u2019\nShe rose with a brisk movement. \u2018You came up here\nostensibly, my dear, to go to the sales. I think the right thing\nto do, therefore, would be for us to go to the sales. But\nbefore we set out, we might put one or two little\narrangements in hand. I don\u2019t suppose,\u2019 Miss Marple added\nobscurely, \u2018that I shall need the old speckled tweed with the\nbeaver collar just at present.\u2019\nIt was about an hour and a half later that the two ladies,\nrather the worse for wear and battered in appearance, and\nboth clasping parcels of hardly-won household linen, sat\ndown at a small and sequestered hostelry called the Apple\nBough to restore their forces with steak and kidney pudding\nfollowed by apple tart and custard.\n\u2018Really a prewar quality face towel,\u2019 gasped Miss Marple,\nslightly out of breath. \u2018With a J on it, too. So fortunate that\n\n----Page Break----\nRaymond\u2019s wife\u2019s name is Joan. I shall put them aside until I\nreally need them and then they will do for her if I pass on\nsooner than I expect.\u2019\n\u2018I really did need the glass-cloths,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018And they\nwere very cheap, though not as cheap as the ones that\nwoman with the ginger hair managed to snatch from me.\u2019\nA smart young woman with a lavish application of rouge\nand lipstick entered the Apple Bough at that moment. After\nlooking around vaguely for a moment or two, she hurried to\ntheir table. She laid down an envelope by Miss Marple\u2019s\nelbow.\n\u2018There you are, miss,\u2019 she said briskly.\n\u2018Oh, thank you, Gladys,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018Thank you\nvery much. So kind of you.\u2019\n\u2018Always pleased to oblige, I\u2019m sure,\u2019 said Gladys. \u2018Ernie\nalways says to me, \u201cEverything what\u2019s good you learned\nfrom that Miss Marple of yours that you were in service\nwith,\u201d and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m always glad to oblige you, miss.\u2019\n\u2018Such a dear girl,\u2019 said Miss Marple as Gladys departed\nagain. \u2018Always so willing and so kind.\u2019\nShe looked inside the envelope and then passed it on to\nBunch. \u2018Now be very careful, dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018By the way, is\nthere still that nice young inspector at Melchester that I\nremember?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018I expect so.\u2019\n\u2018Well, if not,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully. \u2018I can always\nring up the Chief Constable. I think he would remember me.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Of course he\u2019d remember you,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Everybody\nwould remember you. You\u2019re quite unique.\u2019 She rose.\nArrived at Paddington, Bunch went to the luggage o\ufb03ce\nand produced the cloakroom ticket. A moment or two later a\nrather shabby old suitcase was passed across to her, and\ncarrying this she made her way to the platform.\nThe journey home was uneventful. Bunch rose as the\ntrain approached Chipping Cleghorn and picked up the old\nsuitcase. She had just left her carriage when a man,\nsprinting along the platform, suddenly seized the suitcase\nfrom her hand and rushed o\ufb00 with it.\n\u2018Stop!\u2019 Bunch yelled. \u2018Stop him, stop him. He\u2019s taken my\nsuitcase.\u2019\nThe ticket collector who, at this rural station, was a man\nof somewhat slow processes, had just begun to say, \u2018Now,\nlook here, you can\u2019t do that\u2014\u2019 when a smart blow on the\nchest pushed him aside, and the man with the suitcase\nrushed out from the station. He made his way towards a\nwaiting car. Tossing the suitcase in, he was about to climb\nafter it, but before he could move a hand fell on his\nshoulder, and the voice of Police Constable Abel said, \u2018Now\nthen, what\u2019s all this?\u2019\nBunch arrived, panting, from the station. \u2018He snatched\nmy suitcase. I just got out of the train with it.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense,\u2019 said the man. \u2018I don\u2019t know what this lady\nmeans. It\u2019s my suitcase. I just got out of the train with it.\u2019\nHe looked at Bunch with a bovine and impartial stare.\nNobody would have guessed that Police Constable Abel and\nMrs Harmon spent long half-hours in Police Constable Abel\u2019s\n\n----Page Break----\no\ufb00-time discussing the respective merits of manure and\nbone meal for rose bushes.\n\u2018You say, madam, that this is your suitcase?\u2019 said Police\nConstable Abel.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018De\ufb01nitely.\u2019\n\u2018And you, sir?\u2019\n\u2018I say this suitcase is mine.\u2019\nThe man was tall, dark and well dressed, with a drawling\nvoice and a superior manner. A feminine voice from inside\nthe car said, \u2018Of course it\u2019s your suitcase, Edwin. I don\u2019t\nknow what this woman means.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ll have to get this clear,\u2019 said Police Constable Abel.\n\u2018If it\u2019s your suitcase, madam, what do you say is inside it?\u2019\n\u2018Clothes,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018A long speckled coat with a\nbeaver collar, two wool jumpers and a pair of shoes.\u2019\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s clear enough,\u2019 said Police Constable Abel. He\nturned to the other.\n\u2018I am a theatrical costumer,\u2019 said the dark man\nimportantly. \u2018This suitcase contains theatrical properties\nwhich I brought down here for an amateur performance.\u2019\n\u2018Right, sir,\u2019 said Police Constable Abel. \u2018Well, we\u2019ll just\nlook inside, shall we, and see? We can go along to the police\nstation, or if you\u2019re in a hurry we\u2019ll take the suitcase back to\nthe station and open it there.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019ll suit me,\u2019 said the dark man. \u2018My name is Moss, by\nthe way, Edwin Moss.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThe police constable, holding the suitcase, went back\ninto the station. \u2018Just taking this into the parcels o\ufb03ce,\nGeorge,\u2019 he said to the ticket collector.\nPolice Constable Abel laid the suitcase on the counter of\nthe parcels o\ufb03ce and pushed back the clasp. The case was\nnot locked. Bunch and Mr Edwin Moss stood on either side of\nhim, their eyes regarding each other vengefully.\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 said Police Constable Abel, as he pushed up the lid.\nInside, neatly folded, was a long rather shabby tweed\ncoat with a beaver fur collar. There were also two wool\njumpers and a pair of country shoes.\n\u2018Exactly as you say, madam,\u2019 said Police Constable Abel,\nturning to Bunch.\nNobody could have said that Mr Edwin Moss under-did\nthings. His dismay and compunction were magni\ufb01cent.\n\u2018I do apologize,\u2019 he said. \u2018I really do apologize. Please\nbelieve me, dear lady, when I tell you how very, very sorry I\nam. Unpardonable\u2014quite unpardonable\u2014my behaviour has\nbeen.\u2019 He looked at his watch. \u2018I must rush now. Probably\nmy suitcase has gone on the train.\u2019 Raising his hat once\nmore, he said meltingly to Bunch, \u2018Do, do forgive me,\u2019 and\nrushed hurriedly out of the parcels o\ufb03ce.\n\u2018Are you going to let him get away?\u2019 asked Bunch in a\nconspiratorial whisper to Police Constable Abel.\nThe latter slowly closed a bovine eye in a wink.\n\u2018He won\u2019t get too far, ma\u2019am,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s to say he\nwon\u2019t get far unobserved, if you take my meaning.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 said Bunch, relieved.\n\u2018That old lady\u2019s been on the phone,\u2019 said Police Constable\nAbel, \u2018the one as was down here a few years ago. Bright she\nis, isn\u2019t she? But there\u2019s been a lot cooking up all today.\nShouldn\u2019t wonder if the inspector or sergeant was out to see\nyou about it tomorrow morning.\u2019\nIII\nIt was the inspector who came, the Inspector Craddock\nwhom Miss Marple remembered. He greeted Bunch with a\nsmile as an old friend.\n\u2018Crime in Chipping Cleghorn again,\u2019 he said cheerfully.\n\u2018You don\u2019t lack for sensation here, do you, Mrs Harmon?\u2019\n\u2018I could do with rather less,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Have you come\nto ask me questions or are you going to tell me things for a\nchange?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll tell you some things \ufb01rst,\u2019 said the inspector. \u2018To\nbegin with, Mr and Mrs Eccles have been having an eye kept\non them for some time. There\u2019s reason to believe they\u2019ve\nbeen connected with several robberies in this part of the\nworld. For another thing, although Mrs Eccles has a brother\ncalled Sandbourne who has recently come back from\nabroad, the man you found dying in the church yesterday\nwas de\ufb01nitely not Sandbourne.\u2019\n\u2018I knew that he wasn\u2019t,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018His name was\nWalter, to begin with, not William.\u2019\nThe inspector nodded. \u2018His name was Walter St John, and\nhe escaped forty-eight hours ago from Charrington Prison.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Bunch softly to herself, \u2018he was being\nhunted down by the law, and he took sanctuary.\u2019 Then she\nasked, \u2018What had he done?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll have to go back rather a long way. It\u2019s a complicated\nstory. Several years ago there was a certain dancer doing\nturns at the music halls. I don\u2019t expect you\u2019ll have ever\nheard of her, but she specialized in an Arabian Night turn,\n\u201cAladdin in the Cave of Jewels\u201d it was called. She wore bits\nof rhinestone and not much else.\n\u2018She wasn\u2019t much of a dancer, I believe, but she was\u2014\nwell\u2014attractive. Anyway, a certain Asiatic royalty fell for her\nin a big way. Amongst other things he gave her a very\nmagni\ufb01cent emerald necklace.\u2019\n\u2018The historic jewels of a Rajah?\u2019 murmured Bunch\necstatically.\nInspector Craddock coughed. \u2018Well, a rather more\nmodern version, Mrs Harmon. The a\ufb00air didn\u2019t last very\nlong, broke up when our potentate\u2019s attention was captured\nby a certain \ufb01lm star whose demands were not quite so\nmodest.\n\u2018Zobeida, to give the dancer her stage name, hung on to\nthe necklace, and in due course it was stolen. It disappeared\nfrom her dressing-room at the theatre, and there was a\nlingering suspicion in the minds of the authorities that she\nherself might have engineered its disappearance. Such\nthings have been known as a publicity stunt, or indeed from\nmore dishonest motives.\n\u2018The necklace was never recovered, but during the\ncourse of the investigation the attention of the police was\ndrawn to this man, Walter St John. He was a man of\neducation and breeding who had come down in the world,\n\n----Page Break----\nand who was employed as a working jeweller with a rather\nobscure \ufb01rm which was suspected of acting as a fence for\njewel robberies.\n\u2018There was evidence that this necklace had passed\nthrough his hands. It was, however, in connection with the\ntheft of some other jewellery that he was \ufb01nally brought to\ntrial and convicted and sent to prison. He had not very\nmuch longer to serve, so his escape was rather a surprise.\u2019\n\u2018But why did he come here?\u2019 asked Bunch.\n\u2018We\u2019d like to know that very much, Mrs Harmon.\nFollowing up his trial, it seems that he went \ufb01rst to London.\nHe didn\u2019t visit any of his old associates but he visited an\nelderly woman, a Mrs Jacobs who had formerly been a\ntheatrical dresser. She won\u2019t say a word of what he came\nfor, but according to other lodgers in the house he left\ncarrying a suitcase.\u2019\n\u2018I see,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018He left it in the cloakroom at\nPaddington and then he came down here.\u2019\n\u2018By that time,\u2019 said Inspector Craddock, \u2018Eccles and the\nman who calls himself Edwin Moss were on his trail. They\nwanted that suitcase. They saw him get on the bus. They\nmust have driven out in a car ahead of him and been\nwaiting for him when he left the bus.\u2019\n\u2018And he was murdered?\u2019 said Bunch.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Craddock. \u2018He was shot. It was Eccles\u2019s\nrevolver, but I rather fancy it was Moss who did the\nshooting. Now, Mrs Harmon, what we want to know is,\nwhere is the suitcase that Walter St John actually deposited\nat Paddington Station?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nBunch grinned. \u2018I expect Aunt Jane\u2019s got it by now,\u2019 she\nsaid. \u2018Miss Marple, I mean. That was her plan. She sent a\nformer maid of hers with a suitcase packed with her things\nto the cloakroom at Paddington and we exchanged tickets. I\ncollected her suitcase and brought it down by train. She\nseemed to expect that an attempt would be made to get it\nfrom me.\u2019\nIt was Inspector Craddock\u2019s turn to grin. \u2018So she said\nwhen she rang up. I\u2019m driving up to London to see her. Do\nyou want to come, too, Mrs Harmon?\u2019\n\u2018Wel-l,\u2019 said Bunch, considering. \u2018Wel-l, as a matter of\nfact, it\u2019s very fortunate. I had a toothache last night so I\nreally ought to go to London to see the dentist, oughtn\u2019t I?\u2019\n\u2018De\ufb01nitely,\u2019 said Inspector Craddock\u2026\nMiss Marple looked from Inspector Craddock\u2019s face to the\neager face of Bunch Harmon. The suitcase lay on the table.\n\u2018Of course, I haven\u2019t opened it,\u2019 the old lady said. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t\ndream of doing such a thing till somebody o\ufb03cial arrived.\nBesides,\u2019 she added, with a demurely mischievous Victorian\nsmile, \u2018it\u2019s locked.\u2019\n\u2018Like to make a guess at what\u2019s inside, Miss Marple?\u2019\nasked the inspector.\n\u2018I should imagine, you know,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018that it\nwould be Zobeida\u2019s theatrical costumes. Would you like a\nchisel, Inspector?\u2019\nThe chisel soon did its work. Both women gave a slight\ngasp as the lid \ufb02ew up. The sunlight coming through the\nwindow lit up what seemed like an inexhaustible treasure of\nsparkling jewels, red, blue, green, orange.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Aladdin\u2019s Cave,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018The \ufb02ashing jewels\nthe girl wore to dance.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Inspector Craddock. \u2018Now, what\u2019s so precious\nabout it, do you think, that a man was murdered to get hold\nof it?\u2019\n\u2018She was a shrewd girl, I expect,\u2019 said Miss Marple\nthoughtfully. \u2018She\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she, Inspector?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, died three years ago.\u2019\n\u2018She had this valuable emerald necklace,\u2019 said Miss\nMarple, musingly. \u2018Had the stones taken out of their setting\nand fastened here and there on her theatrical costume,\nwhere everyone would take them for merely coloured\nrhinestones. Then she had a replica made of the real\nnecklace, and that, of course, was what was stolen. No\nwonder it never came on the market. The thief soon\ndiscovered the stones were false.\u2019\n\u2018Here is an envelope,\u2019 said Bunch, pulling aside some of\nthe glittering stones.\nInspector Craddock took it from her and extracted two\no\ufb03cial-looking papers from it. He read aloud, \u2018 \u201cMarriage\nCerti\ufb01cate between Walter Edmund St John and Mary Moss.\u201d\nThat was Zobeida\u2019s real name.\u2019\n\u2018So they were married,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018I see.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s the other?\u2019 asked Bunch.\n\u2018A birth certi\ufb01cate of a daughter, Jewel.\u2019\n\u2018Jewel?\u2019 cried Bunch. \u2018Why, of course. Jewel! Jill! That\u2019s it.\nI see now why he came to Chipping Cleghorn. That\u2019s what\n\n----Page Break----\nhe was trying to say to me. Jewel. The Mundys, you know.\nLaburnum Cottage. They look after a little girl for someone.\nThey\u2019re devoted to her. She\u2019s been like their own\ngranddaughter. Yes, I remember now, her name was Jewel,\nonly, of course, they call her Jill.\n\u2018Mrs Mundy had a stroke about a week ago, and the old\nman\u2019s been very ill with pneumonia. They were both going\nto go to the in\ufb01rmary. I\u2019ve been trying hard to \ufb01nd a good\nhome for Jill somewhere. I didn\u2019t want her taken away to an\ninstitution.\n\u2018I suppose her father heard about it in prison and he\nmanaged to break away and get hold of this suitcase from\nthe old dresser he or his wife left it with. I suppose if the\njewels really belonged to her mother, they can be used for\nthe child now.\u2019\n\u2018I should imagine so, Mrs Harmon. If they\u2019re here.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, they\u2019ll be here all right,\u2019 said Miss Marple\ncheerfully\u2026\nIV\n\u2018Thank goodness you\u2019re back, dear,\u2019 said the Reverend\nJulian Harmon, greeting his wife with a\ufb00ection and a sigh of\ncontent. \u2018Mrs Burt always tries to do her best when you\u2019re\naway, but she really gave me some very peculiar \ufb01sh-cakes\nfor lunch. I didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings so I gave them to\nTiglath Pileser, but even he wouldn\u2019t eat them so I had to\nthrow them out of the window.\u2019\n\u2018Tiglath Pileser,\u2019 said Bunch, stroking the vicarage cat,\nwho was purring against her knee, \u2018is very particular about\n\n----Page Break----\nwhat \ufb01sh he eats. I often tell him he\u2019s got a proud stomach!\u2019\n\u2018And your tooth, dear? Did you have it seen to?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018It didn\u2019t hurt much, and I went to see\nAunt Jane again, too\u2026\u2019\n\u2018Dear old thing,\u2019 said Julian. \u2018I hope she\u2019s not failing at\nall.\u2019\n\u2018Not in the least,\u2019 said Bunch, with a grin.\nThe following morning Bunch took a fresh supply of\nchrysanthemums to the church. The sun was once more\npouring through the east window, and Bunch stood in the\njewelled light on the chancel steps. She said very softly\nunder her breath, \u2018Your little girl will be all right. I\u2019ll see that\nshe is. I promise.\u2019\nThen she tidied up the church, slipped into a pew and\nknelt for a few moments to say her prayers before returning\nto the vicarage to attack the piled-up chores of two\nneglected days.\n\n----Page Break----\nStrange Jest\nI\n\u2018And this,\u2019 said Jane Helier, completing her introductions, \u2018is\nMiss Marple!\u2019\nBeing an actress, she was able to make her point. It was\nclearly the climax, the triumphant \ufb01nale! Her tone was\nequally compounded of reverent awe and triumph.\nThe odd part of it was that the object thus proudly\nproclaimed was merely a gentle, fussy-looking, elderly\nspinster. In the eyes of the two young people who had just,\nby Jane\u2019s good o\ufb03ces, made her acquaintance, there\nshowed incredulity and a tinge of dismay. They were nice-\nlooking people; the girl, Charmian Stroud, slim and dark\u2014\nthe man, Edward Rossiter, a fair-haired, amiable young\ngiant.\nCharmian said a little breathlessly. \u2018Oh! We\u2019re awfully\npleased to meet you.\u2019 But there was doubt in her eyes. She\n\ufb02ung a quick, questioning glance at Jane Helier.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Darling,\u2019 said Jane, answering the glance, \u2018she\u2019s\nabsolutely marvellous. Leave it all to her. I told you I\u2019d get\nher here and I have.\u2019 She added to Miss Marple, \u2018You\u2019ll \ufb01x it\nfor them, I know. It will be easy for you.\u2019\nMiss Marple turned her placid, china-blue eyes towards\nMr Rossiter. \u2018Won\u2019t you tell me,\u2019 she said, \u2018what all this is\nabout?\u2019\n\u2018Jane\u2019s a friend of ours,\u2019 Charmian broke in impatiently.\n\u2018Edward and I are in rather a \ufb01x. Jane said if we would come\nto her party, she\u2019d introduce us to someone who was\u2014who\nwould\u2014who could\u2014\u2019\nEdward came to the rescue. \u2018Jane tells us you\u2019re the last\nword in sleuths, Miss Marple!\u2019\nThe old lady\u2019s eyes twinkled, but she protested modestly.\n\u2018Oh, no, no! Nothing of the kind. It\u2019s just that living in a\nvillage as I do, one gets to know so much about human\nnature. But really you have made me quite curious. Do tell\nme your problem.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s terribly hackneyed\u2014just buried treasure,\u2019\nsaid Edward.\n\u2018Indeed? But that sounds most exciting!\u2019\n\u2018I know. Like Treasure Island. But our problem lacks the\nusual romantic touches. No point on a chart indicated by a\nskull and crossbones, no directions like \u201cfour paces to the\nleft, west by north\u201d. It\u2019s horribly prosaic\u2014just where we\nought to dig.\u2019\n\u2018Have you tried at all?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I should say we\u2019d dug about two solid square acres! The\nwhole place is ready to be turned into a market garden.\nWe\u2019re just discussing whether to grow vegetable marrows or\npotatoes.\u2019\nCharmian said rather abruptly, \u2018May we really tell you all\nabout it?\u2019\n\u2018But, of course, my dear.\u2019\n\u2018Then let\u2019s \ufb01nd a peaceful spot. Come on, Edward.\u2019 She\nled the way out of the overcrowded and smoke-laden room,\nand they went up the stairs, to a small sitting-room on the\nsecond \ufb02oor.\nWhen they were seated, Charmian began abruptly. \u2018Well,\nhere goes! The story starts with Uncle Mathew, uncle\u2014or\nrather, great-great-uncle\u2014to both of us. He was incredibly\nancient. Edward and I were his only relations. He was fond\nof us and always declared that when he died he would leave\nhis money between us. Well, he died last March and left\neverything he had to be divided equally between Edward\nand myself. What I\u2019ve just said sounds rather callous\u2014I\ndon\u2019t mean that it was right that he died\u2014actually we were\nvery fond of him. But he\u2019d been ill for some time.\n\u2018The point is that the \u201ceverything\u201d he left turned out to\nbe practically nothing at all. And that, frankly, was a bit of a\nblow to us both, wasn\u2019t it, Edward?\u2019\nThe amiable Edward agreed. \u2018You see,\u2019 he said, \u2018we\u2019d\ncounted on it a bit. I mean, when you know a good bit of\nmoney is coming to you, you don\u2019t\u2014well\u2014buckle down and\ntry to make it yourself. I\u2019m in the army\u2014not got anything to\nspeak of outside my pay\u2014and Charmian herself hasn\u2019t got a\nbean. She works as a stage manager in a repertory theatre\n\u2014quite interesting, and she enjoys it\u2014but no money in it.\n\n----Page Break----\nWe\u2019d counted on getting married, but weren\u2019t worried about\nthe money side of it because we both knew we\u2019d be jolly\nwell o\ufb00 some day.\u2019\n\u2018And now, you see, we\u2019re not!\u2019 said Charmian. \u2018What\u2019s\nmore, Ansteys\u2014that\u2019s the family place, and Edward and I\nboth love it\u2014will probably have to be sold. And Edward and I\nfeel we just can\u2019t bear that! But if we don\u2019t \ufb01nd Uncle\nMathew\u2019s money, we shall have to sell.\u2019\nEdward said, \u2018You know, Charmian, we still haven\u2019t come\nto the vital point.\u2019\n\u2018Well, you talk, then.\u2019\nEdward turned to Miss Marple. \u2018It\u2019s like this, you see. As\nUncle Mathew grew older, he got more and more suspicious.\nHe didn\u2019t trust anybody.\u2019\n\u2018Very wise of him,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018The depravity of\nhuman nature is unbelievable.\u2019\n\u2018Well, you may be right. Anyway, Uncle Mathew thought\nso. He had a friend who lost his money in a bank, and\nanother friend who was ruined by an absconding solicitor,\nand he lost some money himself in a fraudulent company.\nHe got so that he used to hold forth at great length that the\nonly safe and sane thing to do was to convert your money\ninto solid bullion and bury it.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018I begin to see.\u2019\n\u2018Yes. Friends argued with him, pointed out that he\u2019d get\nno interest that way, but he held that that didn\u2019t really\nmatter. The bulk of your money, he said, should be \u201ckept in\na box under the bed or buried in the garden\u201d. Those were\nhis words.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nCharmian went on. \u2018And when he died, he left hardly\nanything at all in securities, though he was very rich. So we\nthink that that\u2019s what he must have done.\u2019\nEdward explained. \u2018We found that he had sold securities\nand drawn out large sums of money from time to time, and\nnobody knows what he did with them. But it seems probable\nthat he lived up to his principles, and that he did buy gold\nand bury it.\u2019\n\u2018He didn\u2019t say anything before he died? Leave any paper?\nNo letter?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the maddening part of it. He didn\u2019t. He\u2019d been\nunconscious for some days, but he rallied before he died. He\nlooked at us both and chuckled\u2014a faint, weak little chuckle.\nHe said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right, my pretty pair of doves.\u201d And\nthen he tapped his eye\u2014his right eye\u2014and winked at us.\nAnd then\u2014he died. Poor old Uncle Mathew.\u2019\n\u2018He tapped his eye,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully.\nEdward said eagerly. \u2018Does that convey anything to you?\nIt made me think of an Arsene Lupin story where there was\nsomething hidden in a man\u2019s glass eye. But Uncle Mathew\ndidn\u2019t have a glass eye.\u2019\nMiss Marple shook her head. \u2018No\u2014I can\u2019t think of\nanything at the moment.\u2019\nCharmian said disappointedly, \u2018Jane told us you\u2019d say at\nonce where to dig!\u2019\nMiss Marple smiled. \u2018I\u2019m not quite a conjurer, you know. I\ndidn\u2019t know your uncle, or what sort of man he was, and I\ndon\u2019t know the house or the grounds.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nCharmian said, \u2018If you did know them?\u2019\n\u2018Well, it must be quite simple, really, mustn\u2019t it?\u2019 said\nMiss Marple.\n\u2018Simple!\u2019 said Charmian. \u2018You come down to Ansteys and\nsee if it\u2019s simple!\u2019\nIt is possible that she did not mean the invitation to be\ntaken seriously, but Miss Marple said briskly, \u2018Well, really,\nmy dear, that\u2019s very kind of you. I\u2019ve always wanted to have\nthe chance of looking for buried treasure. And,\u2019 she added,\nlooking at them with a beaming, late-Victorian smile, \u2018with a\nlove interest, too!\u2019\nII\n\u2018You see!\u2019 said Charmian, gesturing dramatically.\nThey had just completed a grand tour of Ansteys. They\nhad been round the kitchen garden\u2014heavily trenched. They\nhad been through the little woods, where every important\ntree had been dug round, and had gazed sadly on the pitted\nsurface of the once smooth lawn. They had been up to the\nattic, where old trunks and chests had been ri\ufb02ed of their\ncontents. They had been down to the cellars, where\n\ufb02agstones had been heaved unwillingly from their sockets.\nThey had measured and tapped walls, and Miss Marple had\nbeen shown every antique piece of furniture that contained\nor could be suspected of containing a secret drawer.\nOn a table in the morning-room there was a heap of\npapers\u2014all the papers that the late Mathew Stroud had left.\nNot one had been destroyed, and Charmian and Edward\nwere wont to return to them again and again, earnestly\n\n----Page Break----\nperusing bills, invitations, and business correspondence in\nthe hope of spotting a hitherto unnoticed clue.\n\u2018Can you think of anywhere we haven\u2019t looked?\u2019\ndemanded Charmian hopefully.\nMiss Marple shook her head. \u2018You seem to have been\nvery thorough, my dear. Perhaps, if I may say so, just a little\ntoo thorough. I always think, you know, that one should\nhave a plan. It\u2019s like my friend, Mrs Eldritch, she had such a\nnice little maid, polished linoleum beautifully, but she was\nso thorough that she polished the bathroom \ufb02oor too much,\nand as Mrs Eldritch was stepping out of the bath the cork\nmat slipped from under her, and she had a very nasty fall\nand actually broke her leg! Most awkward, because the\nbathroom door was locked, of course, and the gardener had\nto get a ladder and come in through the window\u2014terribly\ndistressing to Mrs Eldritch, who had always been a very\nmodest woman.\u2019\nEdward moved restlessly.\nMiss Marple said quickly, \u2018Please forgive me. So apt, I\nknow, to \ufb02y o\ufb00 at a tangent. But one thing does remind one\nof another. And sometimes that is helpful. All I was trying to\nsay was that perhaps if we tried to sharpen our wits and\nthink of a likely place\u2014\u2019\nEdward said crossly, \u2018You think of one, Miss Marple.\nCharmian\u2019s brains and mine are now only beautiful blanks!\u2019\n\u2018Dear, dear. Of course\u2014most tiring for you. If you don\u2019t\nmind I\u2019ll just look through all this.\u2019 She indicated the papers\non the table. \u2018That is, if there\u2019s nothing private\u2014I don\u2019t want\nto appear to pry.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh, that\u2019s all right. But I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t \ufb01nd\nanything.\u2019\nShe sat down by the table and methodically worked\nthrough the sheaf of documents. As she replaced each one,\nshe sorted them automatically into tidy little heaps. When\nshe had \ufb01nished she sat staring in front of her for some\nminutes.\nEdward asked, not without a touch of malice, \u2018Well, Miss\nMarple?\u2019\nMiss Marple came to herself with a little start. \u2018I beg your\npardon. Most helpful.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve found something relevant?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, nothing like that, but I do believe I know what\nsort of man your Uncle Mathew was. Rather like my own\nUncle Henry, I think. Fond of rather obvious jokes. A\nbachelor, evidently\u2014I wonder why\u2014perhaps an early\ndisappointment? Methodical up to a point, but not very fond\nof being tied up\u2014so few bachelors are!\u2019\nBehind Miss Marple\u2019s back, Charmian made a sign to\nEdward. It said, She\u2019s ga-ga.\nMiss Marple was continuing happily to talk of her\ndeceased Uncle Henry. \u2018Very fond of puns, he was. And to\nsome people, puns are most annoying. A mere play upon\nwords may be very irritating. He was a suspicious man, too.\nAlways was convinced the servants were robbing him. And\nsometimes, of course, they were, but not always. It grew\nupon him, poor man. Towards the end he suspected them of\ntampering with his food, and \ufb01nally refused to eat anything\nbut boiled eggs! Said nobody could tamper with the inside\nof a boiled egg. Dear Uncle Henry, he used to be such a\n\n----Page Break----\nmerry soul at one time\u2014very fond of his co\ufb00ee after dinner.\nHe always used to say, \u201cThis co\ufb00ee is very Moorish,\u201d\nmeaning, you know, that he\u2019d like a little more.\u2019\nEdward felt that if he heard any more about Uncle Henry\nhe\u2019d go mad.\n\u2018Fond of young people, too,\u2019 went on Miss Marple, \u2018but\ninclined to tease them a little, if you know what I mean.\nUsed to put bags of sweets where a child just couldn\u2019t reach\nthem.\u2019\nCasting politeness aside, Charmian said, \u2018I think he\nsounds horrible!\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, dear, just an old bachelor, you know, and not\nused to children. And he wasn\u2019t at all stupid, really. He used\nto keep a good deal of money in the house, and he had a\nsafe put in. Made a great fuss about it\u2014and how very secure\nit was. As a result of his talking so much, burglars broke in\none night and actually cut a hole in the safe with a chemical\ndevice.\u2019\n\u2018Served him right,\u2019 said Edward.\n\u2018Oh, but there was nothing in the safe,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018You see, he really kept the money somewhere else\u2014behind\nsome volumes of sermons in the library, as a matter of fact.\nHe said people never took a book of that kind out of the\nshelf!\u2019\nEdward interrupted excitedly. \u2018I say, that\u2019s an idea. What\nabout the library?\u2019\nBut Charmian shook a scornful head. \u2018Do you think I\nhadn\u2019t thought of that? I went through all the books Tuesday\n\n----Page Break----\nof last week, when you went o\ufb00 to Portsmouth. Took them\nall out, shook them. Nothing there.\u2019\nEdward sighed. Then, rousing himself, he endeavoured to\nrid himself tactfully of their disappointing guest. \u2018It\u2019s been\nawfully good of you to come down as you have and try to\nhelp us. Sorry it\u2019s been all a wash-out. Feel we trespassed a\nlot on your time. However\u2014I\u2019ll get the car out, and you\u2019ll be\nable to catch the three-thirty\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018but we\u2019ve got to \ufb01nd the money,\nhaven\u2019t we? You mustn\u2019t give up, Mr Rossiter. \u201cIf at \ufb01rst you\ndon\u2019t succeed, try, try, try again.\u201d \u2019\n\u2018You mean you\u2019re going to\u2014go on trying?\u2019\n\u2018Strictly speaking,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018I haven\u2019t begun yet.\n\u201cFirst catch your hare\u2014\u201d as Mrs Beaton says in her cookery\nbook\u2014a wonderful book but terribly expensive; most of the\nrecipes begin, \u201cTake a quart of cream and a dozen eggs.\u201d\nLet me see, where was I? Oh, yes. Well, we have, so to\nspeak, caught our hare\u2014the hare being, of course, your\nUncle Mathew, and we\u2019ve only got to decide now where he\nwould have hidden the money. It ought to be quite simple.\u2019\n\u2018Simple?\u2019 demanded Charmian.\n\u2018Oh, yes, dear. I\u2019m sure he would have done the obvious\nthing. A secret drawer\u2014that\u2019s my solution.\u2019\nEdward said dryly, \u2018You couldn\u2019t put bars of gold in a\nsecret drawer.\u2019\n\u2018No, no, of course not. But there\u2019s no reason to believe\nthe money is in gold.\u2019\n\u2018He always used to say\u2014\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018So did my Uncle Henry about his safe! So I should\nstrongly suspect that that was just a blind. Diamonds\u2014now\nthey could be in a secret drawer quite easily.\u2019\n\u2018But we\u2019ve looked in all the secret drawers. We had a\ncabinetmaker over to examine the furniture.\u2019\n\u2018Did you, dear? That was clever of you. I should suggest\nyour uncle\u2019s own desk would be the most likely. Was it the\ntall escritoire against the wall there?\u2019\n\u2018Yes. And I\u2019ll show you.\u2019 Charmian went over to it. She\ntook down the \ufb02ap. Inside were pigeonholes and little\ndrawers. She opened a small door in the centre and touched\na spring inside the left-hand drawer. The bottom of the\ncentre recess clicked and slid forward. Charmian drew it out,\nrevealing a shallow well beneath. It was empty.\n\u2018Now isn\u2019t that a coincidence?\u2019 exclaimed Miss Marple.\n\u2018Uncle Henry had a desk just like this, only his was burr\nwalnut and this is mahogany.\u2019\n\u2018At any rate,\u2019 said Charmian, \u2018there\u2019s nothing there, as\nyou can see.\u2019\n\u2018I expect,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018your cabinetmaker was a\nyoung man. He didn\u2019t know everything. People were very\nartful when they made hiding-places in those days. There\u2019s\nsuch a thing as a secret inside a secret.\u2019\nShe extracted a hairpin from her neat bun of grey hair.\nStraightening it out, she stuck the point into what appeared\nto be a tiny wormhole in one side of the secret recess. With\na little di\ufb03culty she pulled out a small drawer. In it was a\nbundle of faded letters and a folded paper.\n\n----Page Break----\nEdward and Charmian pounced on the \ufb01nd together. With\ntrembling \ufb01ngers Edward unfolded the paper. He dropped it\nwith an exclamation of disgust.\n\u2018A damned cookery recipe. Baked ham!\u2019\nCharmian was untying a ribbon that held the letters\ntogether. She drew one out and glanced at it. \u2018Love letters!\u2019\nMiss \nMarple \nreacted \nwith \nVictorian \ngusto. \n\u2018How\ninteresting! Perhaps the reason your uncle never married.\u2019\nCharmian read aloud:\n\u2018 \u201cMy ever dear Mathew, I must confess that the time\nseems long indeed since I received your last letter. I\ntry to occupy myself with the various tasks allotted to\nme, and often say to myself that I am indeed\nfortunate to see so much of the globe, though little\ndid I think when I went to America that I should\nvoyage o\ufb00 to these far islands!\u14fc\u14fc \u2019\nCharmain broke o\ufb00. \u2018Where is it from? Oh! Hawaii!\u2019 She\nwent on:\n\u2018 \u201cAlas, these natives are still far from seeing the light.\nThey are in an unclothed and savage state and spend\nmost of their time swimming and dancing, adorning\nthemselves with garlands of \ufb02owers. Mr Gray has\nmade some converts but it is uphill work, and he and\nMrs Gray get sadly discouraged. I try to do all I can to\ncheer and encourage him, but I, too, am often sad for\na reason you can guess, dear Mathew. Alas, absence\nis a severe trial for a loving heart. Your renewed vows\nand protestations of a\ufb00ection cheered me greatly.\n\n----Page Break----\nNow and always you have my faithful and devoted\nheart, dear Mathew, and I remain\u2014Your true love,\nBetty Martin.\n\u2018 \u201cPS\u2014I address my letter under cover to our\nmutual friend, Matilda Graves, as usual. I hope heaven\nwill pardon this little subterfuge.\u201d \u2019\nEdward whistled. \u2018A female missionary! So that was Uncle\nMathew\u2019s romance. I wonder why they never married?\u2019\n\u2018She seems to have gone all over the world,\u2019 said\nCharmian, looking through the letters. \u2018Mauritius\u2014all sorts\nof places. Probably died of yellow fever or something.\u2019\nA gentle chuckle made them start. Miss Marple was\napparently much amused. \u2018Well, well,\u2019 she said. \u2018Fancy that,\nnow!\u2019\nShe was reading the recipe for baked ham. Seeing their\nenquiring glances, she read out: \u2018 \u201cBaked ham with spinach.\nTake a nice piece of gammon, stu\ufb00 with cloves, and cover\nwith brown sugar. Bake in a slow oven. Serve with a border\nof pureed spinach.\u201d What do you think of that, now?\u2019\n\u2018I think it sounds \ufb01lthy,\u2019 said Edward.\n\u2018No, no, actually it would be very good\u2014but what do you\nthink of the whole thing?\u2019\nA sudden ray of light illuminated Edward\u2019s face. \u2018Do you\nthink it\u2019s a code\u2014cryptogram of some kind?\u2019 He seized it.\n\u2018Look here, Charmian, it might be, you know! No reason to\nput a cooking-recipe in a secret drawer otherwise.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018Very, very signi\ufb01cant.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nCharmian said, \u2018I know what it might be\u2014invisible ink!\nLet\u2019s heat it. Turn on the electric \ufb01re.\u2019\nEdward did so, but no signs of writing appeared under\nthe treatment.\nMiss Marple coughed. \u2018I really think, you know, that\nyou\u2019re making it rather too di\ufb03cult. The recipe is only an\nindication, so to speak. It is, I think, the letters that are\nsigni\ufb01cant.\u2019\n\u2018The letters?\u2019\n\u2018Especially,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018the signature.\u2019\nBut Edward hardly heard her. He called excitedly,\n\u2018Charmian! Come here! She\u2019s right. See\u2014the envelopes are\nold, right enough, but the letters themselves were written\nmuch later.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018They\u2019re only fake old. I bet anything old Uncle Mat faked\nthem himself\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Precisely,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018The whole thing\u2019s a sell. There never was a female\nmissionary. It must be a code.\u2019\n\u2018My dear, dear children\u2014there\u2019s really no need to make it\nall so di\ufb03cult. Your uncle was really a very simple man. He\nhad to have his little joke, that was all.\u2019\nFor the \ufb01rst time they gave her their full attention.\n\u2018Just exactly what do you mean, Miss Marple?\u2019 asked\nCharmian.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I mean, dear, that you\u2019re actually holding the money in\nyour hand this minute.\u2019\nCharmian stared down.\n\u2018The signature, dear. That gives the whole thing away.\nThe recipe is just an indication. Shorn of all the cloves and\nbrown sugar and the rest of it, what is it actually? Why,\ngammon and spinach to be sure! Gammon and spinach!\nMeaning\u2014nonsense! So it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s the letters that\nare important. And then, if you take into consideration what\nyour uncle did just before he died. He tapped his eye, you\nsaid. Well, there you are\u2014that gives you the clue, you see.\u2019\nCharmian said, \u2018Are we mad, or are you?\u2019\n\u2018Surely, my dear, you must have heard the expression\nmeaning that something is not a true picture, or has it quite\ndied out nowadays? \u201cAll my eye and Betty Martin.\u201d \u2019\nEdward gasped, his eyes falling to the letter in his hand.\n\u2018Betty Martin\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Of course, Mr Rossiter. As you have just said, there isn\u2019t\n\u2014there wasn\u2019t any such person. The letters were written by\nyour uncle, and I dare say he got a lot of fun out of writing\nthem! As you say, the writing on the envelopes is much\nolder\u2014in fact, the envelope couldn\u2019t belong to the letters,\nanyway, because the postmark of one you are holding is\neighteen \ufb01fty-one.\u2019\nShe paused. She made it very emphatic. \u2018Eighteen \ufb01fty-\none. And that explains everything, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\u2018Not to me,\u2019 said Edward.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, of course,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018I dare say it wouldn\u2019t\nto me if it weren\u2019t for my great-nephew Lionel. Such a dear\nlittle boy and a passionate stamp collector. Knows all about\nstamps. It was he who told me about the rare and expensive\nstamps and that a wonderful new \ufb01nd had come up for\nauction. And I actually remember his mentioning one stamp\n\u2014an eighteen \ufb01fty-one blue two-cent. It realized something\nlike twenty-\ufb01ve thousand dollars, I believe. Fancy! I should\nimagine that the other stamps are something also rare and\nexpensive. No doubt your uncle bought through dealers and\nwas careful to \u201ccover his tracks\u201d, as they say in detective\nstories.\u2019\nEdward groaned. He sat down and buried his face in his\nhands.\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 demanded Charmian.\n\u2018Nothing. It\u2019s only the awful thought that, but for Miss\nMarple, we might have burned these letters in a decent,\ngentlemanly way!\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018that\u2019s just what these old\ngentlemen who are fond of their jokes never realize. Uncle\nHenry, I remember, sent a favourite niece a \ufb01ve-pound note\nfor a Christmas present. He put it in a Christmas card,\ngummed the card together, and wrote on it, \u201cLove and best\nwishes. Afraid this is all I can manage this year.\u201d \u2019\n\u2018She, poor girl, was annoyed at what she thought was his\nmeanness and threw it all straight into the \ufb01re; then, of\ncourse, he had to give her another.\u2019\nEdward\u2019s feelings towards Uncle Henry had su\ufb00ered an\nabrupt and complete change.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Miss Marple,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to get a bottle of\nchampagne. We\u2019ll all drink the health of your Uncle Henry.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nTape-Measure Murder\nI\nMiss Politt took hold of the knocker and rapped politely on\nthe cottage door. After a discreet interval she knocked\nagain. The parcel under her left arm shifted a little as she\ndid so, and she readjusted it. Inside the parcel was Mrs\nSpenlow\u2019s new green winter dress, ready for \ufb01tting. From\nMiss Politt\u2019s left hand dangled a bag of black silk, containing\na tape measure, a pincushion, and a large, practical pair of\nscissors.\nMiss Politt was tall and gaunt, with a sharp nose, pursed\nlips, and meagre iron-grey hair. She hesitated before using\nthe knocker for the third time. Glancing down the street, she\nsaw a \ufb01gure rapidly approaching. Miss Hartnell, jolly,\nweather-beaten, \ufb01fty-\ufb01ve, shouted out in her usual loud\nbass voice, \u2018Good afternoon, Miss Politt!\u2019\nThe \ndressmaker \nanswered, \n\u2018Good \nafternoon, \nMiss\nHartnell.\u2019 Her voice was excessively thin and genteel in its\naccents. She had started life as a lady\u2019s maid. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019\nshe went on, \u2018but do you happen to know if by any chance\nMrs Spenlow isn\u2019t at home?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Not the least idea,\u2019 said Miss Hartnell.\n\u2018It\u2019s rather awkward, you see. I was to \ufb01t on Mrs\nSpenlow\u2019s new dress this afternoon. Three-thirty, she said.\u2019\nMiss Hartnell consulted her wrist watch. \u2018It\u2019s a little past\nthe half-hour now.\u2019\n\u2018Yes. I have knocked three times, but there doesn\u2019t seem\nto be any answer, so I was wondering if perhaps Mrs\nSpenlow might have gone out and forgotten. She doesn\u2019t\nforget appointments as a rule, and she wants the dress to\nwear the day after tomorrow.\u2019\nMiss Hartnell entered the gate and walked up the path to\njoin Miss Politt outside the door of Laburnum Cottage.\n\u2018Why doesn\u2019t Gladys answer the door?\u2019 she demanded.\n\u2018Oh, no, of course, it\u2019s Thursday\u2014Gladys\u2019s day out. I expect\nMrs Spenlow has fallen asleep. I don\u2019t expect you\u2019ve made\nenough noise with this thing.\u2019\nSeizing the knocker, she executed a deafening rat-a-tat-\ntat, and in addition thumped upon the panels of the door.\nShe also called out in a stentorian voice, \u2018What ho, within\nthere!\u2019\nThere was no response.\nMiss Politt murmured, \u2018Oh, I think Mrs Spenlow must have\nforgotten and gone out, I\u2019ll call round some other time.\u2019 She\nbegan edging away down the path.\n\u2018Nonsense,\u2019 said Miss Hartnell \ufb01rmly. \u2018She can\u2019t have\ngone out. I\u2019d have met her. I\u2019ll just take a look through the\nwindows and see if I can \ufb01nd any signs of life.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nShe laughed in her usual hearty manner, to indicate that\nit was a joke, and applied a perfunctory glance to the\nnearest window-pane\u2014perfunctory because she knew quite\nwell that the front room was seldom used, Mr and Mrs\nSpenlow preferring the small back sitting-room.\nPerfunctory as it was, though, it succeeded in its object.\nMiss Hartnell, it is true, saw no signs of life. On the contrary,\nshe saw, through the window, Mrs Spenlow lying on the\nhearthrug\u2014dead.\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Miss Hartnell, telling the story\nafterwards, \u2018I managed to keep my head. That Politt\ncreature wouldn\u2019t have had the least idea of what to do.\n\u201cGot to keep our heads,\u201d I said to her. \u201cYou stay here, and I\u2019ll\ngo for Constable Palk.\u201d She said something about not\nwanting to be left, but I paid no attention at all. One has to\nbe \ufb01rm with that sort of person. I\u2019ve always found they\nenjoy making a fuss. So I was just going o\ufb00 when, at that\nvery moment, Mr Spenlow came round the corner of the\nhouse.\u2019\nHere Miss Hartnell made a signi\ufb01cant pause. It enabled\nher audience to ask breathlessly, \u2018Tell me, how did he look?\u2019\nMiss Hartnell would then go on, \u2018Frankly, I suspected\nsomething at once! He was far too calm. He didn\u2019t seem\nsurprised in the least. And you may say what you like, it\nisn\u2019t natural for a man to hear that his wife is dead and\ndisplay no emotion whatever.\u2019\nEverybody agreed with this statement.\nThe police agreed with it, too. So suspicious did they\nconsider Mr Spenlow\u2019s detachment, that they lost no time in\nascertaining how that gentleman was situated as a result of\nhis wife\u2019s death. When they discovered that Mrs Spenlow\n\n----Page Break----\nhad been the monied partner, and that her money went to\nher husband under a will made soon after their marriage,\nthey were more suspicious than ever.\nMiss Marple, that sweet-faced\u2014and, some said, vinegar-\ntongued\u2014elderly spinster who lived in the house next to the\nrectory, was interviewed very early\u2014within half an hour of\nthe discovery of the crime. She was approached by Police\nConstable Palk, importantly thumbing a notebook. \u2018If you\ndon\u2019t mind, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ve a few questions to ask you.\u2019\nMiss Marple said, \u2018In connection with the murder of Mrs\nSpenlow?\u2019\nPalk was startled. \u2018May I ask, madam, how you got to\nknow of it?\u2019\n\u2018The \ufb01sh,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\nThe reply was perfectly intelligible to Constable Palk. He\nassumed correctly that the \ufb01shmonger\u2019s boy had brought it,\ntogether with Miss Marple\u2019s evening meal.\nMiss Marple continued gently. \u2018Lying on the \ufb02oor in the\nsitting-room, strangled\u2014possibly by a very narrow belt. But\nwhatever it was, it was taken away.\u2019\nPalk\u2019s face was wrathful. \u2018How that young Fred gets to\nknow everything\u2014\u2019\nMiss Marple cut him short adroitly. She said, \u2018There\u2019s a\npin in your tunic.\u2019\nConstable Palk looked down, startled. He said, \u2018They do\nsay, \u201cSee a pin and pick it up, all the day you\u2019ll have good\nluck.\u201d \u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I hope that will come true. Now what is it you want me\nto tell you?\u2019\nConstable Palk cleared his throat, looked important, and\nconsulted his notebook. \u2018Statement was made to me by Mr\nArthur Spenlow, husband of the deceased. Mr Spenlow says\nthat at two-thirty, as far as he can say, he was rung up by\nMiss Marple, and asked if he would come over at a quarter\npast three as she was anxious to consult him about\nsomething. Now, ma\u2019am, is that true?\u2019\n\u2018Certainly not,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018You did not ring up Mr Spenlow at two-thirty?\u2019\n\u2018Neither at two-thirty nor any other time.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Constable Palk, and sucked his moustache with\na good deal of satisfaction.\n\u2018What else did Mr Spenlow say?\u2019\n\u2018Mr Spenlow\u2019s statement was that he came over here as\nrequested, leaving his own house at ten minutes past three;\nthat on arrival here he was informed by the maid-servant\nthat Miss Marple was \u201cnot at \u2019ome\u201d.\u2019\n\u2018That part of it is true,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018He did come\nhere, but I was at a meeting at the Women\u2019s Institute.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Constable Palk again.\nMiss Marple exclaimed, \u2018Do tell me, Constable, do you\nsuspect Mr Spenlow?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not for me to say at this stage, but it looks to me as\nthough somebody, naming no names, has been trying to be\n\n----Page Break----\nartful.\u2019\nMiss Marple said thoughtfully, \u2018Mr Spenlow?\u2019\nShe liked Mr Spenlow. He was a small, spare man, sti\ufb00\nand conventional in speech, the acme of respectability. It\nseemed odd that he should have come to live in the\ncountry, he had so clearly lived in towns all his life. To Miss\nMarple he con\ufb01ded the reason. He said, \u2018I have always\nintended, ever since I was a small boy, to live in the country\nsome day and have a garden of my own. I have always been\nvery much attached to \ufb02owers. My wife, you know, kept a\n\ufb02ower shop. That\u2019s where I saw her \ufb01rst.\u2019\nA dry statement, but it opened up a vista of romance. A\nyounger, prettier Mrs Spenlow, seen against a background\nof \ufb02owers.\nMr Spenlow, however, really knew nothing about \ufb02owers.\nHe had no idea of seeds, of cuttings, of bedding out, of\nannuals or perennials. He had only a vision\u2014a vision of a\nsmall cottage garden thickly planted with sweet-smelling,\nbrightly \ncoloured \nblossoms. \nHe \nhad \nasked, \nalmost\npathetically, for instruction, and had noted down Miss\nMarple\u2019s replies to questions in a little book.\nHe was a man of quiet method. It was, perhaps, because\nof this trait, that the police were interested in him when his\nwife was found murdered. With patience and perseverance\nthey learned a good deal about the late Mrs Spenlow\u2014and\nsoon all St Mary Mead knew it, too.\nThe late Mrs Spenlow had begun life as a between-maid\nin a large house. She had left that position to marry the\nsecond gardener, and with him had started a \ufb02ower shop in\nLondon. The shop had prospered. Not so the gardener, who\nbefore long had sickened and died.\n\n----Page Break----\nHis widow carried on the shop and enlarged it in an\nambitious way. She had continued to prosper. Then she had\nsold the business at a handsome price and embarked upon\nmatrimony for the second time\u2014with Mr Spenlow, a middle-\naged jeweller who had inherited a small and struggling\nbusiness. Not long afterwards, they had sold the business\nand came down to St Mary Mead.\nMrs Spenlow was a well-to-do woman. The pro\ufb01ts from\nher \ufb02orist\u2019s establishment she had invested\u2014\u2018under spirit\nguidance\u2019, as she explained to all and sundry. The spirits\nhad advised her with unexpected acumen.\nAll her investments had prospered, some in quite a\nsensational fashion. Instead, however, of this increasing her\nbelief in spiritualism, Mrs Spenlow basely deserted mediums\nand sittings, and made a brief but wholehearted plunge into\nan obscure religion with Indian a\ufb03nities which was based on\nvarious forms of deep breathing. When, however, she\narrived at St Mary Mead, she had relapsed into a period of\northodox Church-of-England beliefs. She was a good deal at\nthe vicarage, and attended church services with assiduity.\nShe patronized the village shops, took an interest in the\nlocal happenings, and played village bridge.\nA humdrum, everyday life. And\u2014suddenly\u2014murder.\nII\nColonel Melchett, the chief constable, had summoned\nInspector Slack.\nSlack was a positive type of man. When he had made up\nhis mind, he was sure. He was quite sure now. \u2018Husband did\nit, sir,\u2019 he said.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You think so?\u2019\n\u2018Quite sure of it. You\u2019ve only got to look at him. Guilty as\nhell. Never showed a sign of grief or emotion. He came back\nto the house knowing she was dead.\u2019\n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t he at least have tried to act the part of the\ndistracted husband?\u2019\n\u2018Not him, sir. Too pleased with himself. Some gentlemen\ncan\u2019t act. Too sti\ufb00.\u2019\n\u2018Any other woman in his life?\u2019 Colonel Melchett asked.\n\u2018Haven\u2019t been able to \ufb01nd any trace of one. Of course,\nhe\u2019s the artful kind. He\u2019d cover his tracks. As I see it, he was\njust fed up with his wife. She\u2019d got the money, and I should\nsay was a trying woman to live with\u2014always taking up with\nsome \u201cism\u201d or other. He cold-bloodedly decided to do away\nwith her and live comfortably on his own.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, that could be the case, I suppose.\u2019\n\u2018Depend upon it, that was it. Made his plans careful.\nPretended to get a phone call\u2014\u2019\nMelchett interrupted him. \u2018No call been traced?\u2019\n\u2018No, sir. That means either that he lied, or that the call\nwas put through from a public telephone booth. The only\ntwo public phones in the village are at the station and the\npost o\ufb03ce. Post o\ufb03ce it certainly wasn\u2019t. Mrs Blade sees\neveryone who comes in. Station it might be. Train arrives at\ntwo twenty-seven and there\u2019s a bit of a bustle then. But the\nmain thing is he says it was Miss Marple who called him up,\nand that certainly isn\u2019t true. The call didn\u2019t come from her\nhouse, and she herself was away at the Institute.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You\u2019re not overlooking the possibility that the husband\nwas deliberately got out of the way\u2014by someone who\nwanted to murder Mrs Spenlow?\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re thinking of young Ted Gerard, aren\u2019t you, sir? I\u2019ve\nbeen working on him\u2014what we\u2019re up against there is lack of\nmotive. He doesn\u2019t stand to gain anything.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s an undesirable character, though. Quite a pretty\nlittle spot of embezzlement to his credit.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not saying he isn\u2019t a wrong \u2019un. Still, he did go to his\nboss and own up to that embezzlement. And his employers\nweren\u2019t wise to it.\u2019\n\u2018An Oxford Grouper,\u2019 said Melchett.\n\u2018Yes, sir. Became a convert and went o\ufb00 to do the\nstraight thing and own up to having pinched money. I\u2019m not\nsaying, mind you, that it mayn\u2019t have been astuteness. He\nmay have thought he was suspected and decided to gamble\non honest repentance.\u2019\n\u2018You have a sceptical mind, Slack,\u2019 said Colonel Melchett.\n\u2018By the way, have you talked to Miss Marple at all?\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s she got to do with it, sir?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, nothing. But she hears things, you know. Why don\u2019t\nyou go and have a chat with her? She\u2019s a very sharp old\nlady.\u2019\nSlack changed the subject. \u2018One thing I\u2019ve been meaning\nto ask you, sir. That domestic-service job where the\ndeceased started her career\u2014Sir Robert Abercrombie\u2019s\nplace. That\u2019s where that jewel robbery was\u2014emeralds\u2014\nworth a packet. Never got them. I\u2019ve been looking it up\u2014\n\n----Page Break----\nmust have happened when the Spenlow woman was there,\nthough she\u2019d have been quite a girl at the time. Don\u2019t think\nshe was mixed up in it, do you, sir? Spenlow, you know, was\none of those little tuppenny-ha\u2019penny jewellers\u2014just the\nchap for a fence.\u2019\nMelchett shook his head. \u2018Don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in\nthat. She didn\u2019t even know Spenlow at the time. I remember\nthe case. Opinion in police circles was that a son of the\nhouse was mixed up in it\u2014Jim Abercrombie\u2014awful young\nwaster. Had a pile of debts, and just after the robbery they\nwere all paid o\ufb00\u2014some rich woman, so they said, but I don\u2019t\nknow\u2014Old Abercrombie hedged a bit about the case\u2014tried\nto call the police o\ufb00.\u2019\n\u2018It was just an idea, sir,\u2019 said Slack.\nIII\nMiss Marple received Inspector Slack with grati\ufb01cation,\nespecially when she heard that he had been sent by Colonel\nMelchett.\n\u2018Now, really, that is very kind of Colonel Melchett. I didn\u2019t\nknow he remembered me.\u2019\n\u2018He remembers you, all right. Told me that what you\ndidn\u2019t know of what goes on in St Mary Mead isn\u2019t worth\nknowing.\u2019\n\u2018Too kind of him, but really I don\u2019t know anything at all.\nAbout this murder, I mean.\u2019\n\u2018You know what the talk about it is.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh, of course\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t do, would it, to repeat just\nidle talk?\u2019\nSlack said, with an attempt at geniality, \u2018This isn\u2019t an\no\ufb03cial conversation, you know. It\u2019s in con\ufb01dence, so to\nspeak.\u2019\n\u2018You mean you really want to know what people are\nsaying? Whether there\u2019s any truth in it or not?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the idea.\u2019\n\u2018Well, of course, there\u2019s been a great deal of talk and\nspeculation. And there are really two distinct camps, if you\nunderstand me. To begin with, there are the people who\nthink that the husband did it. A husband or a wife is, in a\nway, the natural person to suspect, don\u2019t you think so?\u2019\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said the inspector cautiously.\n\u2018Such close quarters, you know. Then, so often, the\nmoney angle. I hear that it was Mrs Spenlow who had the\nmoney, and therefore Mr Spenlow does bene\ufb01t by her\ndeath. In this wicked world I\u2019m afraid the most uncharitable\nassumptions are often justi\ufb01ed.\u2019\n\u2018He comes into a tidy sum, all right.\u2019\n\u2018Just so. It would seem quite plausible, wouldn\u2019t it, for\nhim to strangle her, leave the house by the back, come\nacross the \ufb01elds to my house, ask for me and pretend he\u2019d\nhad a telephone call from me, then go back and \ufb01nd his wife\nmurdered in his absence\u2014hoping, of course, that the crime\nwould be put down to some tramp or burglar.\u2019\nThe inspector nodded. \u2018What with the money angle\u2014and\nif they\u2019d been on bad terms lately\u2014\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nBut Miss Marple interrupted him. \u2018Oh, but they hadn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018You know that for a fact?\u2019\n\u2018Everyone would have known if they\u2019d quarrelled! The\nmaid, Gladys Brent\u2014she\u2019d have soon spread it round the\nvillage.\u2019\nThe inspector said feebly, \u2018She mightn\u2019t have known\u2014\u2019\nand received a pitying smile in reply.\nMiss Marple went on. \u2018And then there\u2019s the other school\nof thought. Ted Gerard. A good-looking young man. I\u2019m\nafraid, you know, that good looks are inclined to in\ufb02uence\none more than they should. Our last curate but one\u2014quite a\nmagical e\ufb00ect! All the girls came to church\u2014evening service\nas well as morning. And many older women became\nunusually active in parish work\u2014and the slippers and scarfs\nthat were made for him! Quite embarrassing for the poor\nyoung man.\n\u2018But let me see, where was I? Oh, yes, this young man,\nTed Gerard. Of course, there has been talk about him. He\u2019s\ncome down to see her so often. Though Mrs Spenlow told\nme herself that he was a member of what I think they call\nthe Oxford Group. A religious movement. They are quite\nsincere and very earnest, I believe, and Mrs Spenlow was\nimpressed by it all.\u2019\nMiss Marple took a breath and went on. \u2018And I\u2019m sure\nthere was no reason to believe that there was anything\nmore in it than that, but you know what people are. Quite a\nlot of people are convinced that Mrs Spenlow was infatuated\nwith the young man, and that she\u2019d lent him quite a lot of\nmoney. And it\u2019s perfectly true that he was actually seen at\nthe station that day. In the train\u2014the two twenty-seven\ndown train. But of course it would be quite easy, wouldn\u2019t it,\n\n----Page Break----\nto slip out of the other side of the train and go through the\ncutting and over the fence and round by the hedge and\nnever come out of the station entrance at all. So that he\nneed not have been seen going to the cottage. And, of\ncourse, people do think that what Mrs Spenlow was wearing\nwas rather peculiar.\u2019\n\u2018Peculiar?\u2019\n\u2018A kimono. Not a dress.\u2019 Miss Marple blushed. \u2018That sort\nof thing, you know, is, perhaps, rather suggestive to some\npeople.\u2019\n\u2018You think it was suggestive?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, I don\u2019t think so, I think it was perfectly natural.\u2019\n\u2018You think it was natural?\u2019\n\u2018Under the circumstances, yes.\u2019 Miss Marple\u2019s glance was\ncool and re\ufb02ective.\nInspector Slack said, \u2018It might give us another motive for\nthe husband. Jealousy.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, Mr Spenlow would never be jealous. He\u2019s not the\nsort of man who notices things. If his wife had gone away\nand left a note on the pincushion, it would be the \ufb01rst he\u2019d\nknow of anything of that kind.\u2019\nInspector Slack was puzzled by the intent way she was\nlooking at him. He had an idea that all her conversation was\nintended to hint at something he didn\u2019t understand. She\nsaid now, with some emphasis, \u2018Didn\u2019t you \ufb01nd any clues,\nInspector\u2014on the spot?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018People don\u2019t leave \ufb01ngerprints and cigarette ash\nnowadays, Miss Marple.\u2019\n\u2018But this, I think,\u2019 she suggested, \u2018was an old-fashioned\ncrime\u2014\u2019\nSlack said sharply, \u2018Now what do you mean by that?\u2019\nMiss Marple remarked slowly, \u2018I think, you know, that\nConstable Palk could help you. He was the \ufb01rst person on\nthe\u2014on the \u201cscene of the crime\u201d, as they say.\u2019\nIV\nMr Spenlow was sitting in a deck chair. He looked\nbewildered. He said, in his thin, precise voice, \u2018I may, of\ncourse, be imagining what occurred. My hearing is not as\ngood as it was. But I distinctly think I heard a small boy call\nafter me, \u201cYah, who\u2019s a Crippen?\u201d It\u2014it conveyed the\nimpression to me that he was of the opinion that I had\u2014had\nkilled my dear wife.\u2019\nMiss Marple, gently snipping o\ufb00 a dead rose head, said,\n\u2018That was the impression he meant to convey, no doubt.\u2019\n\u2018But what could possibly have put such an idea into a\nchild\u2019s head?\u2019\nMiss Marple coughed. \u2018Listening, no doubt, to the\nopinions of his elders.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2014you really mean that other people think that, also?\u2019\n\u2018Quite half the people in St Mary Mead.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018But\u2014my dear lady\u2014what can possibly have given rise to\nsuch an idea? I was sincerely attached to my wife. She did\nnot, alas, take to living in the country as much as I had\nhoped she would do, but perfect agreement on every\nsubject is an impossible idea. I assure you I feel her loss\nvery keenly.\u2019\n\u2018Probably. But if you will excuse my saying so, you don\u2019t\nsound as though you do.\u2019\nMr Spenlow drew his meagre frame up to its full height.\n\u2018My dear lady, many years ago I read of a certain Chinese\nphilosopher who, when his dearly loved wife was taken from\nhim, continued calmly to beat a gong in the street\u2014a\ncustomary Chinese pastime, I presume\u2014exactly as usual.\nThe people of the city were much impressed by his\nfortitude.\u2019\n\u2018But,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018the people of St Mary Mead react\nrather di\ufb00erently. Chinese philosophy does not appeal to\nthem.\u2019\n\u2018But you understand?\u2019\nMiss Marple nodded. \u2018My Uncle Henry,\u2019 she explained,\n\u2018was a man of unusual self-control. His motto was \u201cNever\ndisplay emotion\u201d. He, too, was very fond of \ufb02owers.\u2019\n\u2018I was thinking,\u2019 said Mr Spenlow with something like\neagerness, \u2018that I might, perhaps, have a pergola on the\nwest side of the cottage. Pink roses and, perhaps, wisteria.\nAnd there is a white starry \ufb02ower, whose name for the\nmoment escapes me\u2014\u2019\nIn the tone in which she spoke to her grandnephew, aged\nthree, Miss Marple said, \u2018I have a very nice catalogue here,\n\n----Page Break----\nwith pictures. Perhaps you would like to look through it\u2014I\nhave to go up to the village.\u2019\nLeaving Mr Spenlow sitting happily in the garden with his\ncatalogue, Miss Marple went up to her room, hastily rolled\nup a dress in a piece of brown paper, and, leaving the\nhouse, walked briskly up to the post o\ufb03ce. Miss Politt, the\ndressmaker, lived in the rooms over the post o\ufb03ce.\nBut Miss Marple did not at once go through the door and\nup the stairs. It was just two-thirty, and, a minute late, the\nMuch Benham bus drew up outside the post o\ufb03ce door. It\nwas one of the events of the day in St Mary Mead. The\npostmistress hurried out with parcels, parcels connected\nwith the shop side of her business, for the post o\ufb03ce also\ndealt in sweets, cheap books, and children\u2019s toys.\nFor some four minutes Miss Marple was alone in the post\no\ufb03ce.\nNot till the postmistress returned to her post did Miss\nMarple go upstairs and explain to Miss Politt that she\nwanted her old grey crepe altered and made more\nfashionable if that were possible. Miss Politt promised to see\nwhat she could do.\nV\nThe chief constable was rather astonished when Miss\nMarple\u2019s name was brought to him. She came in with many\napologies. \u2018So sorry\u2014so very sorry to disturb you. You are so\nbusy, I know, but then you have always been so very kind,\nColonel Melchett, and I felt I would rather come to you\ninstead of Inspector Slack. For one thing, you know, I should\nhate Constable Palk to get into any trouble. Strictly\n\n----Page Break----\nspeaking, I suppose he shouldn\u2019t have touched anything at\nall.\u2019\nColonel Melchett was slightly bewildered. He said, \u2018Palk?\nThat\u2019s the St Mary Mead constable, isn\u2019t it? What has he\nbeen doing?\u2019\n\u2018He picked up a pin, you know. It was in his tunic. And it\noccurred to me at the time that it was quite probable he had\nactually picked it up in Mrs Spenlow\u2019s house.\u2019\n\u2018Quite, quite. But after all, you know, what\u2019s a pin?\nMatter of fact he did pick the pin up just by Mrs Spenlow\u2019s\nbody. Came and told Slack about it yesterday\u2014you put him\nup to that, I gather? Oughtn\u2019t to have touched anything, of\ncourse, but as I said, what\u2019s a pin? It was only a common\npin. Sort of thing any woman might use.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, Colonel Melchett, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. To\na man\u2019s eye, perhaps, it looked like an ordinary pin, but it\nwasn\u2019t. It was a special pin, a very thin pin, the kind you buy\nby the box, the kind used mostly by dressmakers.\u2019\nMelchett stared at her, a faint light of comprehension\nbreaking in on him. Miss Marple nodded her head several\ntimes, eagerly.\n\u2018Yes, of course. It seems to me so obvious. She was in her\nkimono because she was going to try on her new dress, and\nshe went into the front room, and Miss Politt just said\nsomething about measurements and put the tape measure\nround her neck\u2014and then all she\u2019d have to do was to cross\nit and pull\u2014quite easy, so I\u2019ve heard. And then, of course,\nshe\u2019d go outside and pull the door to and stand there\nknocking as though she\u2019d just arrived. But the pin shows\nshe\u2019d already been in the house.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018And it was Miss Politt who telephoned to Spenlow?\u2019\n\u2018Yes. From the post o\ufb03ce at two-thirty\u2014just when the bus\ncomes and the post o\ufb03ce would be empty.\u2019\nColonel Melchett said, \u2018But my dear Miss Marple, why? In\nheaven\u2019s name, why? You can\u2019t have a murder without a\nmotive.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I think, you know, Colonel Melchett, from all I\u2019ve\nheard, that the crime dates from a long time back. It\nreminds me, you know, of my two cousins, Antony and\nGordon. Whatever Antony did always went right for him, and\nwith poor Gordon it was just the other way about. Race\nhorses went lame, and stocks went down, and property\ndepreciated. As I see it, the two women were in it together.\u2019\n\u2018In what?\u2019\n\u2018The robbery. Long ago. Very valuable emeralds, so I\u2019ve\nheard. The lady\u2019s maid and the tweeny. Because one thing\nhasn\u2019t been explained\u2014how, when the tweeny married the\ngardener, did they have enough money to set up a \ufb02ower\nshop?\n\u2018The answer is, it was her share of the\u2014the swag, I think\nis the right expression. Everything she did turned out well.\nMoney made money. But the other one, the lady\u2019s maid,\nmust have been unlucky. She came down to being just a\nvillage dressmaker. Then they met again. Quite all right at\n\ufb01rst, I expect, until Mr Ted Gerard came on the scene.\n\u2018Mrs Spenlow, you see, was already su\ufb00ering from\nconscience, and was inclined to be emotionally religious.\nThis young man no doubt urged her to \u201cface up\u201d and to\n\u201ccome clean\u201d and I dare say she was strung up to do it. But\nMiss Politt didn\u2019t see it that way. All she saw was that she\n\n----Page Break----\nmight go to prison for a robbery she had committed years\nago. So she made up her mind to put a stop to it all. I\u2019m\nafraid, you know, that she was always rather a wicked\nwoman. I don\u2019t believe she\u2019d have turned a hair if that nice,\nstupid Mr Spenlow had been hanged.\u2019\nColonel Melchett said slowly, \u2018We can\u2014er\u2014verify your\ntheory\u2014up to a point. The identity of the Politt woman with\nthe lady\u2019s maid at the Abercrombies\u2019, but\u2014\u2019\nMiss Marple reassured him. \u2018It will be all quite easy. She\u2019s\nthe kind of woman who will break down at once when she\u2019s\ntaxed with the truth. And then, you see, I\u2019ve got her tape\nmeasure. I\u2014er\u2014abstracted it yesterday when I was trying\non. When she misses it and thinks the police have got it\u2014\nwell, she\u2019s quite an ignorant woman and she\u2019ll think it will\nprove the case against her in some way.\u2019\nShe smiled at him encouragingly. \u2018You\u2019ll have no trouble,\nI can assure you.\u2019 It was the tone in which his favourite aunt\nhad once assured him that he could not fail to pass his\nentrance examination into Sandhurst.\nAnd he had passed.\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Case of the Caretaker\nI\n\u2018Well,\u2019 demanded Doctor Haydock of his patient. \u2018And how\ngoes it today?\u2019\nMiss Marple smiled at him wanly from pillows.\n\u2018I suppose, really, that I\u2019m better,\u2019 she admitted, \u2018but I\nfeel so terribly depressed. I can\u2019t help feeling how much\nbetter it would have been if I had died. After all, I\u2019m an old\nwoman. Nobody wants me or cares about me.\u2019\nDoctor Haydock interrupted with his usual brusqueness.\n\u2018Yes, yes, typical after-reaction of this type of \ufb02u. What you\nneed is something to take you out of yourself. A mental\ntonic.\u2019\nMiss Marple sighed and shook her head.\n\u2018And what\u2019s more,\u2019 continued Doctor Haydock, \u2018I\u2019ve\nbrought my medicine with me!\u2019\nHe tossed a long envelope on to the bed.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Just the thing for you. The kind of puzzle that is right up\nyour street.\u2019\n\u2018A puzzle?\u2019 Miss Marple looked interested.\n\u2018Literary e\ufb00ort of mine,\u2019 said the doctor, blushing a little.\n\u2018Tried to make a regular story of it. \u201cHe said,\u201d \u201cshe said,\u201d\n\u201cthe girl thought,\u201d etc. Facts of the story are true.\u2019\n\u2018But why a puzzle?\u2019 asked Miss Marple.\nDoctor Haydock grinned. \u2018Because the interpretation is\nup to you. I want to see if you\u2019re as clever as you always\nmake out.\u2019\nWith that Parthian shot he departed.\nMiss Marple picked up the manuscript and began to read.\n\u2018And where is the bride?\u2019 asked Miss Harmon genially.\nThe village was all agog to see the rich and\nbeautiful young wife that Harry Laxton had brought\nback from abroad. There was a general indulgent\nfeeling that Harry\u2014wicked young scapegrace\u2014had\nhad all the luck. Everyone had always felt indulgent\ntowards Harry. Even the owners of windows that had\nsu\ufb00ered from his indiscriminate use of a catapult had\nfound their indignation dissipated by young Harry\u2019s\nabject expression of regret. He had broken windows,\nrobbed orchards, poached rabbits, and later had run\ninto debt, got entangled with the local tobacconist\u2019s\ndaughter\u2014been disentangled and sent o\ufb00 to Africa\u2014\nand the village as represented by various ageing\nspinsters had murmured indulgently. \u2018Ah, well! Wild\noats! He\u2019ll settle down!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nAnd now, sure enough, the prodigal had returned\u2014\nnot in a\ufb04iction, but in triumph. Harry Laxton had\n\u2018made good\u2019 as the saying goes. He had pulled\nhimself together, worked hard, and had \ufb01nally met\nand successfully wooed a young Anglo-French girl who\nwas the possessor of a considerable fortune.\nHarry might have lived in London, or purchased an\nestate in some fashionable hunting county, but he\npreferred to come back to the part of the world that\nwas home to him. And there, in the most romantic\nway, he purchased the derelict estate in the dower\nhouse of which he had passed his childhood.\nKingsdean House had been unoccupied for nearly\nseventy years. It had gradually fallen into decay and\nabandon. An elderly caretaker and his wife lived in the\none \nhabitable \ncorner \nof \nit. \nIt \nwas \na \nvast,\nunprepossessing grandiose mansion, the gardens\novergrown with rank vegetation and the trees\nhemming it in like some gloomy enchanter\u2019s den.\nThe dower house was a pleasant, unpretentious\nhouse and had been let for a long term of years to\nMajor Laxton, Harry\u2019s father. As a boy, Harry had\nroamed over the Kingsdean estate and knew every\ninch of the tangled woods, and the old house itself\nhad always fascinated him.\nMajor Laxton had died some years ago, so it might\nhave been thought that Harry would have had no ties\nto bring him back\u2014nevertheless it was to the home of\nhis boyhood that Harry brought his bride. The ruined\nold Kingsdean House was pulled down. An army of\nbuilders and contractors swooped down upon the\nplace, and in almost a miraculously short space of\n\n----Page Break----\ntime\u2014so marvellously does wealth tell\u2014the new\nhouse rose white and gleaming among the trees.\nNext came a posse of gardeners and after them a\nprocession of furniture vans.\nThe house was ready. Servants arrived. Lastly, a\ncostly limousine deposited Harry and Mrs Harry at the\nfront door.\nThe village rushed to call, and Mrs Price, who\nowned the largest house, and who considered herself\nto lead society in the place, sent out cards of\ninvitation for a party \u2018to meet the bride\u2019.\nIt was a great event. Several ladies had new frocks\nfor the occasion. Everyone was excited, curious,\nanxious to see this fabulous creature. They said it was\nall so like a fairy story!\nMiss Harmon, weather-beaten, hearty spinster,\nthrew out her question as she squeezed her way\nthrough the crowded drawing-room door. Little Miss\nBrent, a thin, acidulated spinster, \ufb02uttered out\ninformation.\n\u2018Oh, \nmy \ndear, \nquite \ncharming. \nSuch \npretty\nmanners. And quite young. Really, you know, it makes\none feel quite envious to see someone who has\neverything like that. Good looks and money and\nbreeding\u2014most distinguished, nothing in the least\ncommon about her\u2014and dear Harry so devoted!\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Miss Harmon, \u2018it\u2019s early days yet!\u2019\nMiss Brent\u2019s thin nose quivered appreciatively. \u2018Oh,\nmy dear, do you really think\u2014\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018We all know what Harry is,\u2019 said Miss Harmon.\n\u2018We know what he was! But I expect now\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Miss Harmon, \u2018men are always the same.\nOnce a gay deceiver, always a gay deceiver. I know\nthem.\u2019\n\u2018Dear, dear. Poor young thing.\u2019 Miss Brent looked\nmuch happier. \u2018Yes, I expect she\u2019ll have trouble with\nhim. Someone ought really to warn her. I wonder if\nshe\u2019s heard anything of the old story?\u2019\n\u2018It seems so very unfair,\u2019 said Miss Brent, \u2018that she\nshould know nothing. So awkward. Especially with\nonly the one chemist\u2019s shop in the village.\u2019\nFor the erstwhile tobacconist\u2019s daughter was now\nmarried to Mr Edge, the chemist.\n\u2018It would be so much nicer,\u2019 said Miss Brent, \u2018if Mrs\nLaxton were to deal with Boots in Much Benham.\u2019\n\u2018I dare say,\u2019 said Miss Harmon, \u2018that Harry Laxton\nwill suggest that himself.\u2019\nAnd again a signi\ufb01cant look passed between them.\n\u2018But I certainly think,\u2019 said Miss Harmon, \u2018that she\nought to know.\u2019\nII\n\u2018Beasts!\u2019 said Clarice Vane indignantly to her uncle,\nDoctor Haydock. \u2018Absolute beasts some people are.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nHe looked at her curiously.\nShe was a tall, dark girl, handsome, warm-hearted\nand impulsive. Her big brown eyes were alight now\nwith indignation as she said, \u2018All these cats\u2014saying\nthings\u2014hinting things.\u2019\n\u2018About Harry Laxton?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, about his a\ufb00air with the tobacconist\u2019s\ndaughter.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, that!\u2019 The doctor shrugged his shoulders. \u2018A\ngreat many young men have a\ufb00airs of that kind.\u2019\n\u2018Of course they do. And it\u2019s all over. So why harp on\nit? And bring it up years after? It\u2019s like ghouls feasting\non dead bodies.\u2019\n\u2018I dare say, my dear, it does seem like that to you.\nBut you see, they have very little to talk about down\nhere, and so I\u2019m afraid they do tend to dwell upon\npast scandals. But I\u2019m curious to know why it upsets\nyou so much?\u2019\nClarice Vane bit her lip and \ufb02ushed. She said, in a\ncuriously mu\ufb04ed voice. \u2018They\u2014they look so happy.\nThe Laxtons, I mean. They\u2019re young and in love, and\nit\u2019s all so lovely for them. I hate to think of it being\nspoiled by whispers and hints and innuendoes and\ngeneral beastliness.\u2019\n\u2018H\u2019m. I see.\u2019\nClarice went on. \u2018He was talking to me just now.\nHe\u2019s so happy and eager and excited and\u2014yes,\nthrilled\u2014at having got his heart\u2019s desire and rebuilt\n\n----Page Break----\nKingsdean. He\u2019s like a child about it all. And she\u2014well,\nI don\u2019t suppose anything has ever gone wrong in her\nwhole life. She\u2019s always had everything. You\u2019ve seen\nher. What did you think of her?\u2019\nThe doctor did not answer at once. For other\npeople, Louise Laxton might be an object of envy. A\nspoiled darling of fortune. To him she had brought\nonly the refrain of a popular song heard many years\nago, Poor little rich girl\u2014\nA small, delicate \ufb01gure, with \ufb02axen hair curled\nrather sti\ufb04y round her face and big, wistful blue eyes.\nLouise was drooping a little. The long stream of\ncongratulations had tired her. She was hoping it might\nsoon be time to go. Perhaps, even now, Harry might\nsay so. She looked at him sideways. So tall and broad-\nshouldered with his eager pleasure in this horrible,\ndull party.\nPoor little rich girl\u2014\nIII\n\u2018Ooph!\u2019 It was a sigh of relief.\nHarry turned to look at his wife amusedly. They\nwere driving away from the party.\nShe said, \u2018Darling, what a frightful party!\u2019\nHarry laughed. \u2018Yes, pretty terrible. Never mind, my\nsweet. It had to be done, you know. All these old\npussies knew me when I lived here as a boy. They\u2019d\n\n----Page Break----\nhave been terribly disappointed not to have got a look\nat you close up.\u2019\nLouise made a grimace. She said, \u2018Shall we have to\nsee a lot of them?\u2019\n\u2018What? \nOh, \nno. \nThey\u2019ll \ncome \nand \nmake\nceremonious calls with card cases, and you\u2019ll return\nthe calls and then you needn\u2019t bother any more. You\ncan have your own friends down or whatever you like.\u2019\nLouise said, after a minute or two, \u2018Isn\u2019t there\nanyone amusing living down here?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, yes. There\u2019s the County, you know. Though\nyou may \ufb01nd them a bit dull, too. Mostly interested in\nbulbs and dogs and horses. You\u2019ll ride, of course. You\u2019ll\nenjoy that. There\u2019s a horse over at Eglinton I\u2019d like\nyou to see. A beautiful animal, perfectly trained, no\nvice in him but plenty of spirit.\u2019\nThe car slowed down to take the turn into the gates\nof Kingsdean. Harry wrenched the wheel and swore as\na grotesque \ufb01gure sprang up in the middle of the road\nand he only just managed to avoid it. It stood there,\nshaking a \ufb01st and shouting after them.\nLouise clutched his arm. \u2018Who\u2019s that\u2014that horrible\nold woman?\u2019\nHarry\u2019s brow was black. \u2018That\u2019s old Murgatroyd. She\nand her husband were caretakers in the old house.\nThey were there for nearly thirty years.\u2019\n\u2018Why does she shake her \ufb01st at you?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nHarry\u2019s face got red. \u2018She\u2014well, she resented the\nhouse being pulled down. And she got the sack, of\ncourse. Her husband\u2019s been dead two years. They say\nshe got a bit queer after he died.\u2019\n\u2018Is she\u2014she isn\u2019t\u2014starving?\u2019\nLouise\u2019s \nideas \nwere \nvague \nand \nsomewhat\nmelodramatic. Riches prevented you coming into\ncontact with reality.\nHarry was outraged. \u2018Good Lord, Louise, what an\nidea! I pensioned her o\ufb00, of course\u2014and handsomely,\ntoo! Found her a new cottage and everything.\u2019\nLouise asked, bewildered, \u2018Then why does she\nmind?\u2019\nHarry was frowning, his brows drawn together. \u2018Oh,\nhow should I know? Craziness! She loved the house.\u2019\n\u2018But it was a ruin, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\u2018Of course it was\u2014crumbling to pieces\u2014roof\nleaking\u2014more or less unsafe. All the same I suppose it\nmeant something to her. She\u2019d been there a long\ntime. Oh, I don\u2019t know! The old devil\u2019s cracked, I\nthink.\u2019\nLouise said uneasily, \u2018She\u2014I think she cursed us.\nOh, Harry, I wish she hadn\u2019t.\u2019\nIV\nIt seemed to Louise that her new home was tainted\nand poisoned by the malevolent \ufb01gure of one crazy\n\n----Page Break----\nold woman. When she went out in the car, when she\nrode, when she walked out with the dogs, there was\nalways the same \ufb01gure waiting. Crouched down on\nherself, a battered hat over wisps of iron-grey hair,\nand the slow muttering of imprecations.\nLouise came to believe that Harry was right\u2014the\nold woman was mad. Nevertheless that did not make\nthings easier. Mrs Murgatroyd never actually came to\nthe house, nor did she use de\ufb01nite threats, nor o\ufb00er\nviolence. Her squatting \ufb01gure remained always just\noutside the gates. To appeal to the police would have\nbeen useless and, in any case, Harry Laxton was\naverse to that course of action. It would, he said,\narouse local sympathy for the old brute. He took the\nmatter more easily than Louise did.\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, darling. She\u2019ll get tired of this\nsilly cursing business. Probably she\u2019s only trying it on.\u2019\n\u2018She isn\u2019t, Harry. She\u2014she hates us! I can feel it.\nShe\u2014she\u2019s ill-wishing us.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s not a witch, darling, although she may look\nlike one! Don\u2019t be morbid about it all.\u2019\nLouise was silent. Now that the \ufb01rst excitement of\nsettling in was over, she felt curiously lonely and at a\nloose end. She had been used to life in London and\nthe Riviera. She had no knowledge of or taste for\nEnglish country life. She was ignorant of gardening,\nexcept for the \ufb01nal act of \u2018doing the \ufb02owers\u2019. She did\nnot really care for dogs. She was bored by such\nneighbours as she met. She enjoyed riding best,\nsometimes with Harry, sometimes, when he was busy\nabout the estate, by herself. She hacked through the\n\n----Page Break----\nwoods and lanes, enjoying the easy paces of the\nbeautiful horse that Harry had bought for her. Yet\neven Prince Hal, most sensitive of chestnut steeds,\nwas wont to shy and snort as he carried his mistress\npast the huddled \ufb01gure of a malevolent old woman.\nOne day Louise took her courage in both hands.\nShe was out walking. She had passed Mrs Murgatroyd,\npretending not to notice her, but suddenly she\nswerved back and went right up to her. She said, a\nlittle breathlessly, \u2018What is it? What\u2019s the matter?\nWhat do you want?\u2019\nThe old woman blinked at her. She had a cunning,\ndark gypsy face, with wisps of iron-grey hair, and\nbleared, suspicious eyes. Louise wondered if she\ndrank.\nShe spoke in a whining and yet threatening voice.\n\u2018What do I want, you ask? What, indeed! That which\nhas been took away from me. Who turned me out of\nKingsdean House? I\u2019d lived there, girl and woman, for\nnear on forty years. It was a black deed to turn me out\nand it\u2019s black bad luck it\u2019ll bring to you and him!\u2019\nLouise said, \u2018You\u2019ve got a very nice cottage and\u2014\u2019\nShe broke o\ufb00. The old woman\u2019s arms \ufb02ew up. She\nscreamed, \u2018What\u2019s the good of that to me? It\u2019s my\nown place I want and my own \ufb01re as I sat beside all\nthem years. And as for you and him, I\u2019m telling you\nthere will be no happiness for you in your new \ufb01ne\nhouse. It\u2019s the black sorrow will be upon you! Sorrow\nand death and my curse. May your fair face rot.\u2019\nLouise turned away and broke into a little stumbling\nrun. She thought, I must get away from here! We must\n\n----Page Break----\nsell the house! We must go away.\nAt the moment, such a solution seemed easy to\nher. But Harry\u2019s utter incomprehension took her back.\nHe exclaimed, \u2018Leave here? Sell the house? Because\nof a crazy old woman\u2019s threats? You must be mad.\u2019\n\u2018No, I\u2019m not. But she\u2014she frightens me, I know\nsomething will happen.\u2019\nHarry Laxton said grimly, \u2018Leave Mrs Murgatroyd to\nme. I\u2019ll settle her!\u2019\nV\nA friendship had sprung up between Clarice Vane and\nyoung Mrs Laxton. The two girls were much of an age,\nthough dissimilar both in character and in tastes. In\nClarice\u2019s company, Louise found reassurance. Clarice\nwas so self-reliant, so sure of herself. Louise\nmentioned the matter of Mrs Murgatroyd and her\nthreats, but Clarice seemed to regard the matter as\nmore annoying than frightening.\n\u2018It\u2019s so stupid, that sort of thing,\u2019 she said. \u2018And\nreally very annoying for you.\u2019\n\u2018You know, Clarice, I\u2014I feel quite frightened\nsometimes. My heart gives the most awful jumps.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense, you mustn\u2019t let a silly thing like that get\nyou down. She\u2019ll soon tire of it.\u2019\nShe was silent for a minute or two. Clarice said,\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nLouise paused for a minute, then her answer came\nwith a rush. \u2018I hate this place! I hate being here. The\nwoods and this house, and the awful silence at night,\nand the queer noise owls make. Oh, and the people\nand everything.\u2019\n\u2018The people. What people?\u2019\n\u2018The people in the village. Those prying, gossiping\nold maids.\u2019\nClarice said sharply, \u2018What have they been saying?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know. Nothing particular. But they\u2019ve got\nnasty minds. When you\u2019ve talked to them you feel you\nwouldn\u2019t trust anybody\u2014not anybody at all.\u2019\nClarice said harshly, \u2018Forget them. They\u2019ve nothing\nto do but gossip. And most of the muck they talk they\njust invent.\u2019\nLouise said, \u2018I wish we\u2019d never come here. But\nHarry adores it so.\u2019 Her voice softened.\nClarice thought, How she adores him. She said\nabruptly, \u2018I must go now.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll send you back in the car. Come again soon.\u2019\nClarice nodded. Louise felt comforted by her new\nfriend\u2019s visit. Harry was pleased to \ufb01nd her more\ncheerful and from then on urged her to have Clarice\noften to the house.\nThen one day he said, \u2018Good news for you, darling.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, what?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019ve \ufb01xed the Murgatroyd. She\u2019s got a son in\nAmerica, you know. Well, I\u2019ve arranged for her to go\nout and join him. I\u2019ll pay her passage.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, Harry, how wonderful. I believe I might get to\nlike Kingsdean after all.\u2019\n\u2018Get to like it? Why, it\u2019s the most wonderful place in\nthe world!\u2019\nLouise gave a little shiver. She could not rid herself\nof her superstitious fear so easily.\nVI\nIf the ladies of St Mary Mead had hoped for the\npleasure of imparting information about her husband\u2019s\npast to the bride, this pleasure was denied them by\nHarry Laxton\u2019s own prompt action.\nMiss Harmon and Clarice Vane were both in Mr\nEdge\u2019s shop, the one buying mothballs and the other\na packet of boracic, when Harry Laxton and his wife\ncame in.\nAfter greeting the two ladies, Harry turned to the\ncounter and was just demanding a toothbrush when\nhe stopped in mid-speech and exclaimed heartily,\n\u2018Well, well, just see who\u2019s here! Bella, I do declare.\u2019\nMrs Edge, who had hurried out from the back\nparlour to attend to the congestion of business,\nbeamed back cheerfully at him, showing her big white\nteeth. She had been a dark, handsome girl and was\nstill a reasonably handsome woman, though she had\n\n----Page Break----\nput on weight, and the lines of her face had\ncoarsened; but her large brown eyes were full of\nwarmth as she answered, \u2018Bella, it is, Mr Harry, and\npleased to see you after all these years.\u2019\nHarry turned to his wife. \u2018Bella\u2019s an old \ufb02ame of\nmine, Louise,\u2019 he said. \u2018Head-over-heels in love with\nher, wasn\u2019t I, Bella?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what you say,\u2019 said Mrs Edge.\nLouise laughed. She said, \u2018My husband\u2019s very\nhappy seeing all his old friends again.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Mrs Edge, \u2018we haven\u2019t forgotten you, Mr\nHarry. Seems like a fairy tale to think of you married\nand building up a new house instead of that ruined old\nKingsdean House.\u2019\n\u2018You look very well and blooming,\u2019 said Harry, and\nMrs Edge laughed and said there was nothing wrong\nwith her and what about that toothbrush?\nClarice, watching the ba\ufb04ed look on Miss Harmon\u2019s\nface, said to herself exultantly, Oh, well done, Harry.\nYou\u2019ve spiked their guns.\nVII\nDoctor Haydock said abruptly to his niece, \u2018What\u2019s all\nthis nonsense about old Mrs Murgatroyd hanging\nabout Kingsdean and shaking her \ufb01st and cursing the\nnew regime?\u2019\n\u2018It isn\u2019t nonsense. It\u2019s quite true. It\u2019s upset Louise a\ngood deal.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Tell her she needn\u2019t worry\u2014when the Murgatroyds\nwere caretakers they never stopped grumbling about\nthe place\u2014they only stayed because Murgatroyd\ndrank and couldn\u2019t get another job.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll tell her,\u2019 said Clarice doubtfully, \u2018but I don\u2019t\nthink she\u2019ll believe you. The old woman fairly screams\nwith rage.\u2019\n\u2018Always used to be fond of Harry as a boy. I can\u2019t\nunderstand it.\u2019\nClarice said, \u2018Oh, well\u2014they\u2019ll be rid of her soon.\nHarry\u2019s paying her passage to America.\u2019\nThree days later, Louise was thrown from her horse\nand killed.\nTwo men in a baker\u2019s van were witnesses of the\naccident. They saw Louise ride out of the gates, saw\nthe old woman spring up and stand in the road waving\nher arms and shouting, saw the horse start, swerve,\nand then bolt madly down the road, \ufb02inging Louise\nLaxton over his head.\nOne of them stood over the unconscious \ufb01gure, not\nknowing what to do, while the other rushed to the\nhouse to get help.\nHarry Laxton came running out, his face ghastly.\nThey took o\ufb00 a door of the van and carried her on it to\nthe house. She died without regaining consciousness\nand before the doctor arrived.\n(End of Doctor Haydock\u2019s manuscript.)\n\n----Page Break----\nVIII\nWhen Doctor Haydock arrived the following day, he was\npleased to note that there was a pink \ufb02ush in Miss Marple\u2019s\ncheek and decidedly more animation in her manner.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018what\u2019s the verdict?\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s the problem, Doctor Haydock?\u2019 countered Miss\nMarple.\n\u2018Oh, my dear lady, do I have to tell you that?\u2019\n\u2018I suppose,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018that it\u2019s the curious\nconduct of the caretaker. Why did she behave in that very\nodd way? People do mind being turned out of their old\nhomes. But it wasn\u2019t her home. In fact, she used to\ncomplain and grumble while she was there. Yes, it certainly\nlooks very \ufb01shy. What became of her, by the way?\u2019\n\u2018Did a bunk to Liverpool. The accident scared her.\nThought she\u2019d wait there for her boat.\u2019\n\u2018All very convenient for somebody,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018Yes, I think the \u201cProblem of the Caretaker\u2019s Conduct\u201d can be\nsolved easily enough. Bribery, was it not?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s your solution?\u2019\n\u2018Well, if it wasn\u2019t natural for her to behave in that way,\nshe must have been \u201cputting on an act\u201d as people say, and\nthat means that somebody paid her to do what she did.\u2019\n\u2018And you know who that somebody was?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, I think so. Money again, I\u2019m afraid. And I\u2019ve always\nnoticed that gentlemen always tend to admire the same\n\n----Page Break----\ntype.\u2019\n\u2018Now I\u2019m out of my depth.\u2019\n\u2018No, no, it all hangs together. Harry Laxton admired Bella\nEdge, a dark, vivacious type. Your niece Clarice was the\nsame. But the poor little wife was quite a di\ufb00erent type\u2014\nfair-haired and clinging\u2014not his type at all. So he must have\nmarried her for her money. And murdered her for her\nmoney, too!\u2019\n\u2018You use the word \u201cmurder\u201d?\u2019\n\u2018Well, he sounds the right type. Attractive to women and\nquite unscrupulous. I suppose he wanted to keep his wife\u2019s\nmoney and marry your niece. He may have been seen\ntalking to Mrs Edge. But I don\u2019t fancy he was attached to her\nany more. Though I dare say he made the poor woman think\nhe was, for ends of his own. He soon had her well under his\nthumb, I fancy.\u2019\n\u2018How exactly did he murder her, do you think?\u2019\nMiss Marple stared ahead of her for some minutes with\ndreamy blue eyes.\n\u2018It was very well timed\u2014with the baker\u2019s van as witness.\nThey could see the old woman and, of course, they\u2019d put\ndown the horse\u2019s fright to that. But I should imagine, myself,\nthat an air gun, or perhaps a catapult. Yes, just as the horse\ncame through the gates. The horse bolted, of course, and\nMrs Laxton was thrown.\u2019\nShe paused, frowning.\n\u2018The fall might have killed her. But he couldn\u2019t be sure of\nthat. And he seems the sort of man who would lay his plans\n\n----Page Break----\ncarefully and leave nothing to chance. After all, Mrs Edge\ncould get him something suitable without her husband\nknowing. Otherwise, why would Harry bother with her? Yes, I\nthink he had some powerful drug handy, that could be\nadministered before you arrived. After all, if a woman is\nthrown from her horse and has serious injuries and dies\nwithout recovering consciousness, well\u2014a doctor wouldn\u2019t\nnormally be suspicious, would he? He\u2019d put it down to shock\nor something.\u2019\nDoctor Haydock nodded.\n\u2018Why did you suspect?\u2019 asked Miss Marple.\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t any particular cleverness on my part,\u2019 said\nDoctor Haydock. \u2018It was just the trite, well-known fact that a\nmurderer is so pleased with his cleverness that he doesn\u2019t\ntake proper precautions. I was just saying a few consolatory\nwords to the bereaved husband\u2014and feeling damned sorry\nfor the fellow, too\u2014when he \ufb02ung himself down on the\nsettee to do a bit of play-acting and a hypodermic syringe\nfell out of his pocket.\n\u2018He snatched it up and looked so scared that I began to\nthink. Harry Laxton didn\u2019t drug; he was in perfect health;\nwhat was he doing with a hypodermic syringe? I did the\nautopsy with a view to certain possibilities. I found\nstrophanthin. The rest was easy. There was strophanthin in\nLaxton\u2019s possession, and Bella Edge, questioned by the\npolice, broke down and admitted to having got it for him.\nAnd \ufb01nally old Mrs Murgatroyd confessed that it was Harry\nLaxton who had put her up to the cursing stunt.\u2019\n\u2018And your niece got over it?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, she was attracted by the fellow, but it hadn\u2019t gone\nfar.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThe doctor picked up his manuscript.\n\u2018Full marks to you, Miss Marple\u2014and full marks to me for\nmy prescription. You\u2019re looking almost yourself again.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Case of the Perfect Maid\nI\n\u2018Oh, if you please, madam, could I speak to you a moment?\u2019\nIt might be thought that this request was in the nature of\nan absurdity, since Edna, Miss Marple\u2019s little maid, was\nactually speaking to her mistress at the moment.\nRecognizing the idiom, however, Miss Marple said\npromptly, \u2018Certainly, Edna, come in and shut the door. What\nis it?\u2019\nObediently shutting the door, Edna advanced into the\nroom, pleated the corner of her apron between her \ufb01ngers,\nand swallowed once or twice.\n\u2018Yes, Edna?\u2019 said Miss Marple encouragingly.\n\u2018Oh, please, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s my cousin, Gladdie.\u2019\n\u2018Dear me,\u2019 said Miss Marple, her mind leaping to the\nworst\u2014and, alas, the most usual conclusion. \u2018Not\u2014not in\ntrouble?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nEdna hastened to reassure her. \u2018Oh, no, ma\u2019am, nothing\nof that kind. Gladdie\u2019s not that kind of girl. It\u2019s just that\nshe\u2019s upset. You see, she\u2019s lost her place.\u2019\n\u2018Dear me, I am sorry to hear that. She was at Old Hall,\nwasn\u2019t she, with the Miss\u2014Misses\u2014Skinner?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s right, ma\u2019am. And Gladdie\u2019s very\nupset about it\u2014very upset indeed.\u2019\n\u2018Gladys has changed places rather often before, though,\nhasn\u2019t she?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, yes, ma\u2019am. She\u2019s always one for a change, Gladdie\nis. She never seems to get really settled, if you know what I\nmean. But she\u2019s always been the one to give the notice, you\nsee!\u2019\n\u2018And this time it\u2019s the other way round?\u2019 asked Miss\nMarple dryly.\n\u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, and it\u2019s upset Gladdie something awful.\u2019\nMiss Marple looked slightly surprised. Her recollection of\nGladys, who had occasionally come to drink tea in the\nkitchen on her \u2018days out\u2019, was a stout, giggling girl of\nunshakably equable temperament.\nEdna went on. \u2018You see, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s the way it happened\n\u2014the way Miss Skinner looked.\u2019\n\u2018How,\u2019 enquired Miss Marple patiently, \u2018did Miss Skinner\nlook?\u2019\nThis time Edna got well away with her news bulletin.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh, ma\u2019am, it was ever such a shock to Gladdie. You see,\none of Miss Emily\u2019s brooches was missing, and such a hue\nand cry for it as never was, and of course nobody likes a\nthing like that to happen; it\u2019s upsetting, ma\u2019am, if you know\nwhat I mean. And Gladdie\u2019s helped search everywhere, and\nthere was Miss Lavinia saying she was going to the police\nabout it, and then it turned up again, pushed right to the\nback of a drawer in the dressing-table, and very thankful\nGladdie was.\n\u2018And the very next day as ever was a plate got broken,\nand Miss Lavinia she bounced out right away and told\nGladdie to take a month\u2019s notice. And what Gladdie feels is\nit couldn\u2019t have been the plate and that Miss Lavinia was\njust making an excuse of that, and that it must be because\nof the brooch and they think as she took it and put it back\nwhen the police was mentioned, and Gladdie wouldn\u2019t do\nsuch a thing, not never she wouldn\u2019t, and what she feels is\nas it will get round and tell against her and it\u2019s a very\nserious thing for a girl, as you know, ma\u2019am.\u2019\nMiss Marple nodded. Though having no particular liking\nfor the bouncing, self-opinionated Gladys, she was quite\nsure of the girl\u2019s intrinsic honesty and could well imagine\nthat the a\ufb00air must have upset her.\nEdna said wistfully, \u2018I suppose, ma\u2019am, there isn\u2019t\nanything you could do about it? Gladdie\u2019s in ever such a\ntaking.\u2019\n\u2018Tell her not to be silly,\u2019 said Miss Marple crisply. \u2018If she\ndidn\u2019t take the brooch\u2014which I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t\u2014then she\nhas no cause to be upset.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019ll get about,\u2019 said Edna dismally.\n\n----Page Break----\nMiss Marple said, \u2018I\u2014er\u2014am going up that way this\nafternoon. I\u2019ll have a word with the Misses Skinner.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, thank you, madam,\u2019 said Edna.\nII\nOld Hall was a big Victorian house surrounded by woods and\npark land. Since it had been proved unlettable and\nunsaleable as it was, an enterprising speculator had divided\nit into four \ufb02ats with a central hot-water system, and the\nuse of \u2018the grounds\u2019 to be held in common by the tenants.\nThe experiment had been satisfactory. A rich and eccentric\nold lady and her maid occupied one \ufb02at. The old lady had a\npassion for birds and entertained a feathered gathering to\nmeals every day. A retired Indian judge and his wife rented a\nsecond. A very young couple, recently married, occupied the\nthird, and the fourth had been taken only two months ago\nby two maiden ladies of the name of Skinner. The four sets\nof tenants were only on the most distant terms with each\nother, since none of them had anything in common. The\nlandlord had been heard to say that this was an excellent\nthing. What he dreaded were friendships followed by\nestrangements and subsequent complaints to him.\nMiss Marple was acquainted with all the tenants, though\nshe knew none of them well. The elder Miss Skinner, Miss\nLavinia, was what might be termed the working member of\nthe \ufb01rm, Miss Emily, the younger, spent most of her time in\nbed su\ufb00ering from various complaints which, in the opinion\nof St Mary Mead, were largely imaginary. Only Miss Lavinia\nbelieved devoutly in her sister\u2019s martyrdom and patience\nunder a\ufb04iction, and willingly ran errands and trotted up and\ndown to the village for things that \u2018my sister had suddenly\nfancied\u2019.\n\n----Page Break----\nIt was the view of St Mary Mead that if Miss Emily\nsu\ufb00ered half as much as she said she did, she would have\nsent for Doctor Haydock long ago. But Miss Emily, when this\nwas hinted to her, shut her eyes in a superior way and\nmurmured that her case was not a simple one\u2014the best\nspecialists in London had been ba\ufb04ed by it\u2014and that a\nwonderful new man had put her on a most revolutionary\ncourse of treatment and that she really hoped her health\nwould improve under it. No humdrum GP could possibly\nunderstand her case.\n\u2018And it\u2019s my opinion,\u2019 said the outspoken Miss Hartnell,\n\u2018that she\u2019s very wise not to send for him. Dear Doctor\nHaydock, in that breezy manner of his, would tell her that\nthere was nothing the matter with her and to get up and not\nmake a fuss! Do her a lot of good!\u2019\nFailing such arbitrary treatment, however, Miss Emily\ncontinued to lie on sofas, to surround herself with strange\nlittle pill boxes, and to reject nearly everything that had\nbeen cooked for her and ask for something else\u2014usually\nsomething di\ufb03cult and inconvenient to get.\nIII\nThe door was opened to Miss Marple by \u2018Gladdie\u2019, looking\nmore depressed than Miss Marple had ever thought\npossible. In the sitting-room (a quarter of the late drawing-\nroom, which had been partitioned into a dining-room,\ndrawing-room, bathroom, and housemaid\u2019s cupboard), Miss\nLavinia rose to greet Miss Marple.\nLavinia Skinner was a tall, gaunt, bony female of \ufb01fty.\nShe had a gru\ufb00 voice and an abrupt manner.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Nice to see you,\u2019 she said. \u2018Emily\u2019s lying down\u2014feeling\nlow today, poor dear. Hope she\u2019ll see you, it would cheer her\nup, but there are times when she doesn\u2019t feel up to seeing\nanybody. Poor dear, she\u2019s wonderfully patient.\u2019\nMiss Marple responded politely. Servants were the main\ntopic of conversation in St Mary Mead, so it was not di\ufb03cult\nto lead the conversation in that direction. Miss Marple said\nshe had heard that that nice girl, Gladys Holmes, was\nleaving.\nMiss Lavinia nodded. \u2018Wednesday week. Broke things,\nyou know. Can\u2019t have that.\u2019\nMiss Marple sighed and said we all had to put up with\nthings nowadays. It was so di\ufb03cult to get girls to come to\nthe country. Did Miss Skinner really think it was wise to part\nwith Gladys?\n\u2018Know it\u2019s di\ufb03cult to get servants,\u2019 admitted Miss Lavinia.\n\u2018The Devereuxs haven\u2019t got anybody\u2014but then, I don\u2019t\nwonder\u2014always quarrelling, jazz on all night\u2014meals any\ntime\u2014that girl knows nothing of housekeeping. I pity her\nhusband! Then the Larkins have just lost their maid. Of\ncourse, what with the judge\u2019s Indian temper and his wanting\nchota hazri, as he calls it, at six in the morning and Mrs\nLarkin always fussing, I don\u2019t wonder at that, either. Mrs\nCarmichael\u2019s Janet is a \ufb01xture of course\u2014though in my\nopinion she\u2019s the most disagreeable woman, and absolutely\nbullies the old lady.\u2019\n\u2018Then don\u2019t you think you might reconsider your decision\nabout Gladys? She really is a nice girl. I know all her family;\nvery honest and superior.\u2019\nMiss Lavinia shook her head.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019ve got my reasons,\u2019 she said importantly.\nMiss Marple murmured, \u2018You missed a brooch, I\nunderstand\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Now, who has been talking? I suppose the girl has. Quite\nfrankly, I\u2019m almost certain she took it. And then got\nfrightened and put it back\u2014but, of course, one can\u2019t say\nanything unless one is sure.\u2019 She changed the subject. \u2018Do\ncome and see Emily, Miss Marple. I\u2019m sure it would do her\ngood.\u2019\nMiss Marple followed meekly to where Miss Lavinia\nknocked on a door, was bidden enter, and ushered her\nguest into the best room in the \ufb02at, most of the light of\nwhich was excluded by half-drawn blinds. Miss Emily was\nlying in bed, apparently enjoying the half-gloom and her\nown inde\ufb01nite su\ufb00erings.\nThe dim light showed her to be a thin, indecisive-looking\ncreature, with a good deal of greyish-yellow hair untidily\nwound around her head and erupting into curls, the whole\nthing looking like a bird\u2019s nest of which no self-respecting\nbird could be proud. There was a smell in the room of Eau\nde Cologne, stale biscuits, and camphor.\nWith half-closed eyes and a thin, weak voice, Emily\nSkinner explained that this was \u2018one of her bad days\u2019.\n\u2018The worst of ill health is,\u2019 said Miss Emily in a\nmelancholy tone, \u2018that one knows what a burden one is to\neveryone around one.\n\u2018Lavinia is very good to me. Lavvie dear, I do so hate\ngiving trouble but if my hot-water bottle could only be \ufb01lled\nin the way I like it\u2014too full it weighs on me so\u2014on the other\nhand, if it is not su\ufb03ciently \ufb01lled, it gets cold immediately!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, dear. Give it to me. I will empty a little out.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps, if you\u2019re doing that, it might be re\ufb01lled. There\nare no rusks in the house, I suppose\u2014no, no, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter. I can do without. Some weak tea and a slice of\nlemon\u2014no lemons? No, really, I couldn\u2019t drink tea without\nlemon. I think the milk was slightly turned this morning. It\nhas put me against milk in my tea. It doesn\u2019t matter. I can\ndo without my tea. Only I do feel so weak. Oysters, they say,\nare nourishing. I wonder if I could fancy a few? No, no, too\nmuch bother to get hold of them so late in the day. I can fast\nuntil tomorrow.\u2019\nLavinia left the room murmuring something incoherent\nabout bicycling down to the village.\nMiss Emily smiled feebly at her guest and remarked that\nshe did hate giving anyone any trouble.\nMiss Marple told Edna that evening that she was afraid\nher embassy had met with no success.\nShe was rather troubled to \ufb01nd that rumours as to\nGladys\u2019s dishonesty were already going around the village.\nIn the post o\ufb03ce, Miss Wetherby tackled her. \u2018My dear\nJane, they gave her a written reference saying she was\nwilling and sober and respectable, but saying nothing about\nhonesty. That seems to me most signi\ufb01cant! I hear there\nwas some trouble about a brooch. I think there must be\nsomething in it, you know, because one doesn\u2019t let a\nservant go nowadays unless it\u2019s something rather grave.\nThey\u2019ll \ufb01nd it most di\ufb03cult to get anyone else. Girls simply\nwill not go to Old Hall. They\u2019re nervous coming home on\ntheir days out. You\u2019ll see, the Skinners won\u2019t \ufb01nd anyone\nelse, and then, perhaps, that dreadful hypochondriac sister\nwill have to get up and do something!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nGreat was the chagrin of the village when it was made\nknown that the Misses Skinner had engaged, from an\nagency, a new maid who, by all accounts, was a perfect\nparagon.\n\u2018A three-years\u2019 reference recommending her most\nwarmly, she prefers the country, and actually asks less\nwages than Gladys. I really feel we have been most\nfortunate.\u2019\n\u2018Well, really,\u2019 said Miss Marple, to whom these details\nwere imparted by Miss Lavinia in the \ufb01shmonger\u2019s shop. \u2018It\ndoes seem too good to be true.\u2019\nIt then became the opinion of St Mary Mead that the\nparagon would cry o\ufb00 at the last minute and fail to arrive.\nNone of these prognostications came true, however, and\nthe village was able to observe the domestic treasure, by\nname, Mary Higgins, driving through the village in Reed\u2019s\ntaxi to Old Hall. It had to be admitted that her appearance\nwas good. A most respectable-looking woman, very neatly\ndressed.\nWhen Miss Marple next visited Old Hall, on the occasion\nof recruiting stall-holders for the vicarage fete, Mary Higgins\nopened the door. She was certainly a most superior-looking\nmaid, at a guess forty years of age, with neat black hair,\nrosy cheeks, a plump \ufb01gure discreetly arrayed in black with\na white apron and cap\u2014\u2018quite the good, old-fashioned type\nof servant,\u2019 as Miss Marple explained afterwards, and with\nthe proper, inaudible respectful voice, so di\ufb00erent from the\nloud but adenoidal accents of Gladys.\nMiss Lavinia was looking far less harassed than usual\nand, although she regretted that she could not take a stall\nowing to her preoccupation with her sister, she nevertheless\n\n----Page Break----\ntendered a handsome monetary contribution, and promised\nto produce a consignment of pen-wipers and babies\u2019 socks.\nMiss Marple commented on her air of well-being.\n\u2018I really feel I owe a great deal to Mary, I am so thankful I\nhad the resolution to get rid of that other girl. Mary is really\ninvaluable. Cooks nicely and waits beautifully and keeps our\nlittle \ufb02at scrupulously clean\u2014mattresses turned over every\nday. And she is really wonderful with Emily!\u2019\nMiss Marple hastily enquired after Emily.\n\u2018Oh, poor dear, she has been very much under the\nweather lately. She can\u2019t help it, of course, but it really\nmakes things a little di\ufb03cult sometimes. Wanting certain\nthings cooked and then, when they come, saying she can\u2019t\neat now\u2014and then wanting them again half an hour later\nand everything spoiled and having to be done again. It\nmakes, of course, a lot of work\u2014but fortunately Mary does\nnot seem to mind at all. She\u2019s used to waiting on invalids,\nshe says, and understands them. It is such a comfort.\u2019\n\u2018Dear me,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018You are fortunate.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, indeed. I really feel Mary has been sent to us as an\nanswer to prayer.\u2019\n\u2018She sounds to me,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018almost too good to\nbe true. I should\u2014well, I should be a little careful if I were\nyou.\u2019\nLavinia Skinner failed to perceive the point of this\nremark. She said, \u2018Oh! I assure you I do all I can to make her\ncomfortable. I don\u2019t know what I should do if she left.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I don\u2019t expect she\u2019ll leave until she\u2019s ready to leave,\u2019\nsaid Miss Marple and stared very hard at her hostess.\nMiss Lavinia said, \u2018If one has no domestic worries, it\ntakes such a load o\ufb00 one\u2019s mind, doesn\u2019t it? How is your\nlittle Edna shaping?\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s doing quite nicely. Not much head, of course. Not\nlike your Mary. Still, I do know all about Edna because she\u2019s\na village girl.\u2019\nAs she went out into the hall she heard the invalid\u2019s\nvoice fretfully raised. \u2018This compress has been allowed to\nget quite dry\u2014Doctor Allerton particularly said moisture\ncontinually renewed. There, there, leave it. I want a cup of\ntea and a boiled egg\u2014boiled only three minutes and a half,\nremember, and send Miss Lavinia to me.\u2019\nThe e\ufb03cient Mary emerged from the bedroom and,\nsaying to Lavinia, \u2018Miss Emily is asking for you, madam,\u2019\nproceeded to open the door for Miss Marple, helping her into\nher coat and handing her her umbrella in the most\nirreproachable fashion.\nMiss Marple took the umbrella, dropped it, tried to pick it\nup, and dropped her bag, which \ufb02ew open. Mary politely\nretrieved various odds and ends\u2014a handkerchief, an\nengagement book, an old-fashioned leather purse, two\nshillings, three pennies, and a striped piece of peppermint\nrock.\nMiss Marple received the last with some signs of\nconfusion.\n\u2018Oh, dear, that must have been Mrs Clement\u2019s little boy.\nHe was sucking it, I remember, and he took my bag to play\nwith. He must have put it inside. It\u2019s terribly sticky, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Shall I take it, madam?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, would you? Thank you so much.\u2019\nMary stooped to retrieve the last item, a small mirror,\nupon recovering which Miss Marple exclaimed fervently,\n\u2018How lucky, now, that that isn\u2019t broken.\u2019\nShe thereupon departed, Mary standing politely by the\ndoor holding a piece of striped rock with a completely\nexpressionless face.\nIV\nFor ten days longer St Mary Mead had to endure hearing of\nthe excellencies of Miss Lavinia\u2019s and Miss Emily\u2019s treasure.\nOn the eleventh day, the village awoke to its big thrill.\nMary, the paragon, was missing! Her bed had not been\nslept in, and the front door was found ajar. She had slipped\nout quietly during the night.\nAnd not Mary alone was missing! Two brooches and \ufb01ve\nrings of Miss Lavinia\u2019s; three rings, a pendant, a bracelet,\nand four brooches of Miss Emily\u2019s were missing, also!\nIt was the beginning of a chapter of catastrophe.\nYoung Mrs Devereux had lost her diamonds which she\nkept in an unlocked drawer and also some valuable furs\ngiven to her as a wedding present. The judge and his wife\nalso had had jewellery taken and a certain amount of\nmoney. Mrs Carmichael was the greatest su\ufb00erer. Not only\nhad she some very valuable jewels but she also kept in the\n\ufb02at a large sum of money which had gone. It had been\n\n----Page Break----\nJanet\u2019s evening out, and her mistress was in the habit of\nwalking round the gardens at dusk calling to the birds and\nscattering crumbs. It seemed clear that Mary, the perfect\nmaid, had had keys to \ufb01t all the \ufb02ats!\nThere was, it must be confessed, a certain amount of ill-\nnatured pleasure in St Mary Mead. Miss Lavinia had boasted\nso much of her marvellous Mary.\n\u2018And all the time, my dear, just a common thief!\u2019\nInteresting revelations followed. Not only had Mary\ndisappeared into the blue, but the agency who had provided\nher and vouched for her credentials was alarmed to \ufb01nd\nthat the Mary Higgins who had applied to them and whose\nreferences they had taken up had, to all intents and\npurposes, never existed. It was the name of a bona \ufb01de\nservant who had lived with the bona \ufb01de sister of a dean,\nbut the real Mary Higgins was existing peacefully in a place\nin Cornwall.\n\u2018Damned clever, the whole thing,\u2019 Inspector Slack was\nforced to admit. \u2018And, if you ask me, that woman works with\na gang. There was a case of much the same kind in\nNorthumberland a year ago. Stu\ufb00 was never traced, and\nthey never caught her. However, we\u2019ll do better than that in\nMuch Benham!\u2019\nInspector Slack was always a con\ufb01dent man.\nNevertheless, weeks passed, and Mary Higgins remained\ntriumphantly at large. In vain Inspector Slack redoubled that\nenergy that so belied his name.\nMiss Lavinia remained tearful. Miss Emily was so upset,\nand felt so alarmed by her condition that she actually sent\nfor Doctor Haydock.\n\n----Page Break----\nThe whole of the village was terribly anxious to know\nwhat he thought of Miss Emily\u2019s claims to ill health, but\nnaturally could not ask him. Satisfactory data came to hand\non the subject, however, through Mr Meek, the chemist\u2019s\nassistant, who was walking out with Clara, Mrs Price-Ridley\u2019s\nmaid. It was then known that Doctor Haydock had\nprescribed a mixture of asafoetida and valerian which,\naccording to Mr Meek, was the stock remedy for malingerers\nin the army!\nSoon afterwards it was learned that Miss Emily, not\nrelishing the medical attention she had had, was declaring\nthat in the state of her health she felt it her duty to be near\nthe specialist in London who understood her case. It was,\nshe said, only fair to Lavinia.\nThe \ufb02at was put up for subletting.\nV\nIt was a few days after that that Miss Marple, rather pink\nand \ufb02ustered, called at the police station in Much Benham\nand asked for Inspector Slack.\nInspector Slack did not like Miss Marple. But he was\naware that the Chief Constable, Colonel Melchett, did not\nshare that opinion. Rather grudgingly, therefore, he received\nher.\n\u2018Good afternoon, Miss Marple, what can I do for you?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re in a hurry.\u2019\n\u2018Lots of work on,\u2019 said Inspector Slack, \u2018but I can spare a\nfew moments.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018I hope I shall be able to put\nwhat I say properly. So di\ufb03cult, you know, to explain\noneself, don\u2019t you think? No, perhaps you don\u2019t. But you\nsee, not having been educated in the modern style\u2014just a\ngoverness, you know, who taught one the dates of the kings\nof England and general knowledge\u2014Doctor Brewer\u2014three\nkinds of diseases of wheat\u2014blight, mildew\u2014now what was\nthe third\u2014was it smut?\u2019\n\u2018Do you want to talk about smut?\u2019 asked Inspector Slack\nand then blushed.\n\u2018Oh, no, no.\u2019 Miss Marple hastily disclaimed any wish to\ntalk about smut. \u2018Just an illustration, you know. And how\nneedles are made, and all that. Discursive, you know, but\nnot teaching one to keep to the point. Which is what I want\nto do. It\u2019s about Miss Skinner\u2019s maid, Gladys, you know.\u2019\n\u2018Mary Higgins,\u2019 said Inspector Slack.\n\u2018Oh, yes, the second maid. But it\u2019s Gladys Holmes I mean\n\u2014rather an impertinent girl and far too pleased with herself\nbut really strictly honest, and it\u2019s so important that that\nshould be recognized.\u2019\n\u2018No charge against her so far as I know,\u2019 said the\ninspector.\n\u2018No, I know there isn\u2019t a charge\u2014but that makes it worse.\nBecause, you see, people go on thinking things. Oh, dear\u2014I\nknew I should explain things badly. What I really mean is\nthat the important thing is to \ufb01nd Mary Higgins.\u2019\n\u2018Certainly,\u2019 said Inspector Slack. \u2018Have you any ideas on\nthe subject?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, as a matter of fact, I have,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018May I\nask you a question? Are \ufb01ngerprints of no use to you?\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Inspector Slack, \u2018that\u2019s where she was a bit too\nartful for us. Did most of her work in rubber gloves or\nhousemaid\u2019s gloves, it seems. And she\u2019d been careful\u2014\nwiped o\ufb00 everything in her bedroom and on the sink.\nCouldn\u2019t \ufb01nd a single \ufb01ngerprint in the place!\u2019\n\u2018If you did have \ufb01ngerprints, would it help?\u2019\n\u2018It might, madam. They may be known at the Yard. This\nisn\u2019t her \ufb01rst job, I\u2019d say!\u2019\nMiss Marple nodded brightly. She opened her bag and\nextracted a small cardboard box. Inside it, wedged in cotton\nwool, was a small mirror.\n\u2018From my handbag,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018The maid\u2019s prints\nare on it. I think they should be satisfactory\u2014she touched\nan extremely sticky substance a moment previously.\u2019\nInspector Slack stared. \u2018Did you get her \ufb01ngerprints on\npurpose?\u2019\n\u2018Of course.\u2019\n\u2018You suspected her then?\u2019\n\u2018Well, you know, it did strike me that she was a little too\ngood to be true. I practically told Miss Lavinia so. But she\nsimply wouldn\u2019t take the hint! I\u2019m afraid, you know,\nInspector, that I don\u2019t believe in paragons. Most of us have\nour faults\u2014and domestic service shows them up very\nquickly!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Inspector Slack, recovering his balance, \u2018I\u2019m\nobliged to you, I\u2019m sure. We\u2019ll send these up to the Yard and\nsee what they have to say.\u2019\nHe stopped. Miss Marple had put her head a little on one\nside and was regarding him with a good deal of meaning.\n\u2018You wouldn\u2019t consider, I suppose, Inspector, looking a\nlittle nearer home?\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean, Miss Marple?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s very di\ufb03cult to explain, but when you come across a\npeculiar thing you notice it. Although, often, peculiar things\nmay be the merest tri\ufb02es. I\u2019ve felt that all along, you know; I\nmean about Gladys and the brooch. She\u2019s an honest girl;\nshe didn\u2019t take that brooch. Then why did Miss Skinner think\nshe did? Miss Skinner\u2019s not a fool; far from it! Why was she\nso anxious to let a girl go who was a good servant when\nservants are hard to get? It was peculiar, you know. So I\nwondered. I wondered a good deal. And I noticed another\npeculiar thing! Miss Emily\u2019s a hypochondriac, but she\u2019s the\n\ufb01rst hypochondriac who hasn\u2019t sent for some doctor or other\nat once. Hypochondriacs love doctors, Miss Emily didn\u2019t!\u2019\n\u2018What are you suggesting, Miss Marple?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I\u2019m suggesting, you know, that Miss Lavinia and\nMiss Emily are peculiar people. Miss Emily spends nearly all\nher time in a dark room. And if that hair of hers isn\u2019t a wig I\n\u2014I\u2019ll eat my own back switch! And what I say is this\u2014it\u2019s\nperfectly possible for a thin, pale, grey-haired, whining\nwoman to be the same as a black-haired, rosy-cheeked,\nplump woman. And nobody that I can \ufb01nd ever saw Miss\nEmily and Mary Higgins at one and the same time.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Plenty of time to get impressions of all the keys, plenty\nof time to \ufb01nd out all about the other tenants, and then\u2014get\nrid of the local girl. Miss Emily takes a brisk walk across\ncountry one night and arrives at the station as Mary Higgins\nnext day. And then, at the right moment, Mary Higgins\ndisappears, and o\ufb00 goes the hue and cry after her. I\u2019ll tell\nyou where you\u2019ll \ufb01nd her, Inspector. On Miss Emily Skinner\u2019s\nsofa! Get her \ufb01ngerprints if you don\u2019t believe me, but you\u2019ll\n\ufb01nd I\u2019m right! A couple of clever thieves, that\u2019s what the\nSkinners are\u2014and no doubt in league with a clever post and\nrails or fence or whatever you call it. But they won\u2019t get\naway with it this time! I\u2019m not going to have one of our\nvillage girls\u2019 character for honesty taken away like that!\nGladys Holmes is as honest as the day, and everybody\u2019s\ngoing to know it! Good afternoon!\u2019\nMiss Marple had stalked out before Inspector Slack had\nrecovered.\n\u2018Whew?\u2019 he muttered. \u2018I wonder if she\u2019s right?\u2019\nHe soon found out that Miss Marple was right again.\nColonel Melchett congratulated Slack on his e\ufb03ciency,\nand Miss Marple had Gladys come to tea with Edna and\nspoke to her seriously on settling down in a good situation\nwhen she got one.\n\n----Page Break----\nMiss Marple Tells a Story\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever told you, my dears\u2014you, Raymond,\nand you, Joan, about the rather curious little business that\nhappened some years ago now. I don\u2019t want to seem vain in\nany way\u2014of course I know that in comparison with you\nyoung people I\u2019m not clever at all\u2014Raymond writes those\nvery modern books all about rather unpleasant young men\nand women\u2014and Joan paints those very remarkable\npictures of square people with curious bulges on them\u2014very\nclever of you, my dear, but as Raymond always says (only\nquite kindly, because he is the kindest of nephews) I am\nhopelessly Victorian. I admire Mr Alma-Tadema and Mr\nFrederic Leighton and I suppose to you they seem\nhopelessly vieux jeu. Now let me see, what was I saying?\nOh, yes\u2014that I didn\u2019t want to appear vain\u2014but I couldn\u2019t\nhelp being just a teeny weeny bit pleased with myself,\nbecause, just by applying a little common sense, I believe I\nreally did solve a problem that had ba\ufb04ed cleverer heads\nthan mine. Though really I should have thought the whole\nthing was obvious from the beginning\u2026\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you my little story, and if you think I\u2019m\ninclined to be conceited about it, you must remember that I\n\n----Page Break----\ndid at least help a fellow creature who was in very grave\ndistress.\nThe \ufb01rst I knew of this business was one evening about\nnine o\u2019clock when Gwen\u2014(you remember Gwen? My little\nmaid with red hair) well\u2014Gwen came in and told me that Mr\nPetherick and a gentleman had called to see me. Gwen had\nshown them into the drawing-room\u2014quite rightly. I was\nsitting in the dining-room because in early spring I think it is\nso wasteful to have two \ufb01res going.\nI directed Gwen to bring in the cherry brandy and some\nglasses and I hurried into the drawing-room. I don\u2019t know\nwhether you remember Mr Petherick? He died two years\nago, but he had been a friend of mine for many years as\nwell as attending to all my legal business. A very shrewd\nman and a really clever solicitor. His son does my business\nfor me now\u2014a very nice lad and very up to date\u2014but\nsomehow I don\u2019t feel quite the con\ufb01dence I had with Mr\nPetherick.\nI explained to Mr Petherick about the \ufb01res and he said at\nonce that he and his friend would come into the dining-room\n\u2014and then he introduced his friend\u2014a Mr Rhodes. He was a\nyoungish man\u2014not much over forty\u2014and I saw at once\nthere was something very wrong. His manner was most\npeculiar. One might have called it rude if one hadn\u2019t realized\nthat the poor fellow was su\ufb00ering from strain.\nWhen we were settled in the dining-room and Gwen had\nbrought the cherry brandy, Mr Petherick explained the\nreason for his visit.\n\u2018Miss Marple,\u2019 he said, \u2018you must forgive an old friend for\ntaking a liberty. What I have come here for is a\nconsultation.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nI couldn\u2019t understand at all what he meant, and he went\non:\n\u2018In a case of illness one likes two points of view\u2014that of\nthe specialist and that of the family physician. It is the\nfashion to regard the former as of more value, but I am not\nsure that I agree. The specialist has experience only in his\nown \nsubject\u2014the \nfamily \ndoctor \nhas, \nperhaps, \nless\nknowledge\u2014but a wider experience.\u2019\nI knew just what he meant, because a young niece of\nmine not long before had hurried her child o\ufb00 to a very well-\nknown specialist in skin diseases without consulting her own\ndoctor whom she considered an old dodderer, and the\nspecialist had ordered some very expensive treatment, and\nlater found that all the child was su\ufb00ering from was a rather\nunusual form of measles.\nI just mention this\u2014though I have a horror of digressing\u2014\nto show that I appreciate Mr Petherick\u2019s point\u2014but I still\nhadn\u2019t any idea what he was driving at.\n\u2018If Mr Rhodes is ill\u2014\u2019 I said, and stopped\u2014because the\npoor man gave a most dreadful laugh.\nHe said: \u2018I expect to die of a broken neck in a few\nmonths\u2019 time.\u2019\nAnd then it all came out. There had been a case of\nmurder lately in Barnchester\u2014a town about twenty miles\naway. I\u2019m afraid I hadn\u2019t paid much attention to it at the\ntime, because we had been having a lot of excitement in the\nvillage about our district nurse, and outside occurrences like\nan earthquake in India and a murder in Barnchester,\nalthough of course far more important really\u2014had given\nway to our own little local excitements. I\u2019m afraid villages\nare like that. Still, I did remember having read about a\n\n----Page Break----\nwoman having been stabbed in a hotel, though I hadn\u2019t\nremembered her name. But now it seemed that this woman\nhad been Mr Rhodes\u2019s wife\u2014and as if that wasn\u2019t bad\nenough\u2014he was actually under suspicion of having\nmurdered her himself.\nAll this Mr Petherick explained to me very clearly, saying\nthat, although the Coronor\u2019s jury had brought in a verdict of\nmurder by a person or persons unknown, Mr Rhodes had\nreason to believe that he would probably be arrested within\na day or two, and that he had come to Mr Petherick and\nplaced himself in his hands. Mr Petherick went on to say\nthat they had that afternoon consulted Sir Malcolm Olde,\nK.C., and that in the event of the case coming to trial Sir\nMalcolm had been briefed to defend Mr Rhodes.\nSir Malcolm was a young man, Mr Petherick said, very up\nto date in his methods, and he had indicated a certain line\nof defence. But with that line of defence Mr Petherick was\nnot entirely satis\ufb01ed.\n\u2018You see, my dear lady,\u2019 he said, \u2018it is tainted with what I\ncall the specialist\u2019s point of view. Give Sir Malcolm a case\nand he sees only one point\u2014the most likely line of defence.\nBut even the best line of defence may ignore completely\nwhat is, to my mind, the vital point. It takes no account of\nwhat actually happened.\u2019\nThen he went on to say some very kind and \ufb02attering\nthings about my acumen and judgement and my knowledge\nof human nature, and asked permission to tell me the story\nof the case in the hopes that I might be able to suggest\nsome explanation.\nI could see that Mr Rhodes was highly sceptical of my\nbeing of any use and he was annoyed at being brought\n\n----Page Break----\nhere. But Mr Petherick took no notice and proceeded to give\nme the facts of what occurred on the night of March 8th.\nMr and Mrs Rhodes had been staying at the Crown Hotel\nin Barnchester. Mrs Rhodes who (so I gathered from Mr\nPetherick\u2019s careful language) was perhaps just a shade of a\nhypochondriac, had retired to bed immediately after dinner.\nShe and her husband occupied adjoining rooms with a\nconnecting door. Mr Rhodes, who is writing a book on\nprehistoric \ufb02ints, settled down to work in the adjoining\nroom. At eleven o\u2019clock he tidied up his papers and\nprepared to go to bed. Before doing so, he just glanced into\nhis wife\u2019s room to make sure that there was nothing she\nwanted. He discovered the electric light on and his wife\nlying in bed stabbed through the heart. She had been dead\nat least an hour\u2014probably longer. The following were the\npoints made. There was another door in Mrs Rhodes\u2019s room\nleading into the corridor. This door was locked and bolted on\nthe inside. The only window in the room was closed and\nlatched. According to Mr Rhodes nobody had passed\nthrough the room in which he was sitting except a\nchambermaid bringing hot-water bottles. The weapon found\nin the wound was a stiletto dagger which had been lying on\nMrs Rhodes\u2019s dressing-table. She was in the habit of using it\nas a paper knife. There were no \ufb01ngerprints on it.\nThe situation boiled down to this\u2014no one but Mr Rhodes\nand the chambermaid had entered the victim\u2019s room.\nI enquired about the chambermaid.\n\u2018That was our \ufb01rst line of enquiry,\u2019 said Mr Petherick.\n\u2018Mary Hill is a local woman. She had been chambermaid at\nthe Crown for ten years. There seems absolutely no reason\nwhy she should commit a sudden assault on a guest. She is,\nin any case, extraordinarily stupid, almost half-witted. Her\n\n----Page Break----\nstory has never varied. She brought Mrs Rhodes her hot-\nwater bottle and says the lady was drowsy\u2014just dropping\no\ufb00 to sleep. Frankly, I cannot believe, and I am sure no jury\nwould believe, that she committed the crime.\u2019\nMr Petherick went on to mention a few additional details.\nAt the head of the staircase in the Crown Hotel is a kind of\nminiature lounge where people sometimes sit and have\nco\ufb00ee. A passage goes o\ufb00 to the right and the last door in it\nis the door into the room occupied by Mr Rhodes. The\npassage then turns sharply to the right again and the \ufb01rst\ndoor round the corner is the door into Mrs Rhodes\u2019s room.\nAs it happened, both these doors could be seen by\nwitnesses. The \ufb01rst door\u2014that into Mr Rhodes\u2019s room, which\nI will call A, could be seen by four people, two commercial\ntravellers and an elderly married couple who were having\nco\ufb00ee. According to them nobody went in or out of door A\nexcept Mr Rhodes and the chambermaid. As to the other\ndoor in the passage B, there was an electrician at work\nthere and he also swears that nobody entered or left door B\nexcept the chambermaid.\nIt was certainly a very curious and interesting case. On\nthe face of it, it looked as though Mr Rhodes must have\nmurdered his wife. But I could see that Mr Petherick was\nquite convinced of his client\u2019s innocence and Mr Petherick\nwas a very shrewd man.\nAt the inquest Mr Rhodes had told a hesitating and\nrambling story about some woman who had written\nthreatening letters to his wife. His story, I gathered, had\nbeen unconvincing in the extreme. Appealed to by Mr\nPetherick, he explained himself.\n\u2018Frankly,\u2019 he said, \u2018I never believed it. I thought Amy had\nmade most of it up.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nMrs Rhodes, I gathered, was one of those romantic liars\nwho go through life embroidering everything that happens\nto them. The amount of adventures that, according to her\nown account, happened to her in a year was simply\nincredible. If she slipped on a bit of banana peel it was a\ncase of near escape from death. If a lampshade caught \ufb01re\nshe was rescued from a burning building at the hazard of\nher life. Her husband got into the habit of discounting her\nstatements. Her tale as to some woman whose child she\nhad injured in a motor accident and who had vowed\nvengeance on her\u2014well\u2014Mr Rhodes had simply not taken\nany notice of it. The incident had happened before he\nmarried his wife and although she had read him letters\ncouched in crazy language, he had suspected her of\ncomposing them herself. She had actually done such a thing\nonce or twice before. She was a woman of hysterical\ntendencies who craved ceaselessly for excitement.\nNow, all that seemed to me very natural\u2014indeed, we\nhave a young woman in the village who does much the\nsame thing. The danger with such people is that when\nanything at all extraordinary really does happen to them,\nnobody believes they are speaking the truth. It seemed to\nme that that was what had happened in this case. The\npolice, I gathered, merely believed that Mr Rhodes was\nmaking up this unconvincing tale in order to avert suspicion\nfrom himself.\nI asked if there had been any women staying by\nthemselves in the hotel. It seemed there were two\u2014a Mrs\nGranby, an Anglo-Indian widow, and a Miss Carruthers,\nrather a horsey spinster who dropped her g\u2019s. Mr Petherick\nadded that the most minute enquiries had failed to elicit\nanyone who had seen either of them near the scene of the\ncrime and there was nothing to connect either of them with\nit in any way. I asked him to describe their personal\n\n----Page Break----\nappearance. He said that Mrs Granby had reddish hair\nrather untidily done, was sallow-faced and about \ufb01fty years\nof age. Her clothes were rather picturesque, being made\nmostly of native silk, etc. Miss Carruthers was about forty,\nwore pince-nez, had close-cropped hair like a man and wore\nmannish coats and skirts.\n\u2018Dear me,\u2019 I said, \u2018that makes it very di\ufb03cult.\u2019\nMr Petherick looked enquiringly at me, but I didn\u2019t want\nto say any more just then, so I asked what Sir Malcolm Olde\nhad said.\nSir Malcolm was con\ufb01dent of being able to call con\ufb02icting\nmedical testimony and to suggest some way of getting over\nthe \ufb01ngerprint di\ufb03culty. I asked Mr Rhodes what he thought\nand he said all doctors were fools but he himself couldn\u2019t\nreally believe that his wife had killed herself. \u2018She wasn\u2019t\nthat kind of woman,\u2019 he said simply\u2014and I believed him.\nHysterical people don\u2019t usually commit suicide.\nI thought a minute and then I asked if the door from Mrs\nRhodes\u2019s room led straight into the corridor. Mr Rhodes said\nno\u2014there was a little hallway with a bathroom and lavatory.\nIt was the door from the bedroom to the hallway that was\nlocked and bolted on the inside.\n\u2018In that case,\u2019 I said, \u2018the whole thing seems remarkably\nsimple.\u2019\nAnd really, you know, it did\u2026the simplest thing in the\nworld. And yet no one seemed to have seen it that way.\nBoth Mr Petherick and Mr Rhodes were staring at me so\nthat I felt quite embarrassed.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Mr Rhodes, \u2018Miss Marple hasn\u2019t quite\nappreciated the di\ufb03culties.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 I said, \u2018I think I have. There are four possibilities.\nEither Mrs Rhodes was killed by her husband, or by the\nchambermaid, or she committed suicide, or she was killed\nby an outsider whom nobody saw enter or leave.\u2019\n\u2018And that\u2019s impossible,\u2019 Mr Rhodes broke in. \u2018Nobody\ncould come in or go out through my room without my seeing\nthem, and even if anyone did manage to come in through\nmy wife\u2019s room without the electrician seeing them, how the\ndevil could they get out again leaving the door locked and\nbolted on the inside?\u2019\nMr Petherick looked at me and said: \u2018Well, Miss Marple?\u2019\nin an encouraging manner.\n\u2018I should like,\u2019 I said, \u2018to ask a question. Mr Rhodes, what\ndid the chambermaid look like?\u2019\nHe said he wasn\u2019t sure\u2014she was tallish, he thought\u2014he\ndidn\u2019t remember if she was fair or dark. I turned to Mr\nPetherick and asked the same question.\nHe said she was of medium height, had fairish hair and\nblue eyes and rather a high colour.\nMr Rhodes said: \u2018You are a better observer than I am,\nPetherick.\u2019\nI ventured to disagree. I then asked Mr Rhodes if he could\ndescribe the maid in my house. Neither he nor Mr Petherick\ncould do so.\n\u2018Don\u2019t you see what that means?\u2019 I said. \u2018You both came\nhere full of your own a\ufb00airs and the person who let you in\n\n----Page Break----\nwas only a parlourmaid. The same applies to Mr Rhodes at\nthe hotel. He saw her uniform and her apron. He was\nengrossed by his work. But Mr Petherick has interviewed the\nsame woman in a di\ufb00erent capacity. He has looked at her as\na person.\n\u2018That\u2019s what the woman who did the murder counted\nupon.\u2019\nAs they still didn\u2019t see, I had to explain.\n\u2018I think,\u2019 I said, \u2018that this is how it went. The\nchambermaid came in by door A, passed through Mr\nRhodes\u2019s room into Mrs Rhodes\u2019s room with the hot-water\nbottle and went out through the hallway into passage B. X\u2014\nas I will call our murderess\u2014came in by door B into the little\nhallway, concealed herself in\u2014well, in a certain apartment,\nahem\u2014and waited until the chambermaid had passed out.\nThen she entered Mrs Rhodes\u2019s room, took the stiletto from\nthe dressing table (she had doubtless explored the room\nearlier in the day), went up to the bed, stabbed the dozing\nwoman, wiped the handle of the stiletto, locked and bolted\nthe door by which she had entered, and then passed out\nthrough the room where Mr Rhodes was working.\u2019\nMr Rhodes cried out: \u2018But I should have seen her. The\nelectrician would have seen her go in.\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018That\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. You wouldn\u2019t see\nher\u2014not if she were dressed as a chambermaid.\u2019 I let it sink\nin, then I went on, \u2018You were engrossed in your work\u2014out of\nthe tail of your eye you saw a chambermaid come in, go into\nyour wife\u2019s room, come back and go out. It was the same\ndress\u2014but not the same woman. That\u2019s what the people\nhaving \nco\ufb00ee \nsaw\u2014a \nchambermaid \ngo \nin \nand \na\nchambermaid come out. The electrician did the same. I dare\n\n----Page Break----\nsay if a chambermaid were very pretty a gentleman might\nnotice her face\u2014human nature being what it is\u2014but if she\nwere just an ordinary middle-aged woman\u2014well\u2014it would\nbe the chambermaid\u2019s dress you would see\u2014not the woman\nherself.\u2019\nMr Rhodes cried: \u2018Who was she?\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018that is going to be a little di\ufb03cult. It must\nbe either Mrs Granby or Miss Carruthers. Mrs Granby sounds\nas though she might wear a wig normally\u2014so she could\nwear her own hair as a chambermaid. On the other hand,\nMiss Carruthers with her close-cropped mannish head might\neasily put on a wig to play her part. I dare say you will \ufb01nd\nout easily enough which of them it is. Personally, I incline\nmyself to think it will be Miss Carruthers.\u2019\nAnd really, my dears, that is the end of the story.\nCarruthers was a false name, but she was the woman all\nright. There was insanity in her family. Mrs Rhodes, who was\na most reckless and dangerous driver, had run over her little\ngirl, and it had driven the poor woman o\ufb00 her head. She\nconcealed her madness very cunningly except for writing\ndistinctly insane latters to her intended victim. She had\nbeen following her about for some time, and she laid her\nplans very cleverly. The false hair and maid\u2019s dress she\nposted in a parcel \ufb01rst thing the next morning. When taxed\nwith the truth she broke down and confessed at once. The\npoor thing is in Broadmoor now. Completely unbalanced of\ncourse, but a very cleverly planned crime.\nMr Petherick came to me afterwards and brought me a\nvery nice letter from Mr Rhodes\u2014really, it made me blush.\nThen my old friend said to me: \u2018Just one thing\u2014why did you\nthink it was more likely to be Carruthers than Granby? You\u2019d\nnever seen either of them.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well,\u2019 I said. \u2018It was the g\u2019s. You said she dropped her\ng\u2019s. Now, that\u2019s done by a lot of hunting people in books,\nbut I don\u2019t know many people who do it in reality\u2014and\ncertainly no one under sixty. You said this woman was forty.\nThose dropped g\u2019s sounded to me like a woman who was\nplaying a part and over-doing it.\u2019\nI shan\u2019t tell you what Mr Petherick said to that\u2014but he\nwas very complimentary\u2014and I really couldn\u2019t help feeling\njust a teeny weeny bit pleased with myself.\nAnd it\u2019s extraordinary how things turn out for the best in\nthis world. Mr Rhodes has married again\u2014such a nice,\nsensible girl\u2014and they\u2019ve got a dear little baby and\u2014what\ndo you think?\u2014they asked me to be godmother. Wasn\u2019t it\nnice of them?\nNow I do hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been running on too\nlong\u2026\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Dressmaker\u2019s Doll\nI\nThe doll lay in the big velvet-covered chair. There was not\nmuch light in the room; the London skies were dark. In the\ngentle, greyish-green gloom, the sage-green coverings and\nthe curtains and the rugs all blended with each other. The\ndoll blended, too. She lay long and limp and sprawled in her\ngreen-velvet clothes and her velvet cap and the painted\nmask of her face. She was the Puppet Doll, the whim of Rich\nWomen, the doll who lolls beside the telephone, or among\nthe cushions of the divan. She sprawled there, eternally limp\nand yet strangely alive. She looked a decadent product of\nthe twentieth century.\nSybil Fox, hurrying in with some patterns and a sketch,\nlooked at the doll with a faint feeling of surprise and\nbewilderment. She wondered\u2014but whatever she wondered\ndid not get to the front of her mind. Instead, she thought to\nherself, \u2018Now, what\u2019s happened to the pattern of the blue\nvelvet? Wherever have I put it? I\u2019m sure I had it here just\nnow.\u2019 She went out on the landing and called up to the\nworkroom.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Elspeth, Elspeth, have you the blue pattern up there?\nMrs Fellows-Brown will be here any minute now.\u2019\nShe went in again, switching on the lights. Again she\nglanced at the doll. \u2018Now where on earth\u2014ah, there it is.\u2019\nShe picked the pattern up from where it had fallen from her\nhand. There was the usual creak outside on the landing as\nthe elevator came to a halt and in a minute or two Mrs\nFellows-Brown, accompanied by her Pekinese, came pu\ufb03ng\ninto the room rather like a fussy local train arriving at a\nwayside station.\n\u2018It\u2019s going to pour,\u2019 she said, \u2018simply pour!\u2019\nShe threw o\ufb00 her gloves and a fur. Alicia Coombe came\nin. She didn\u2019t always come in nowadays, only when special\ncustomers arrived, and Mrs Fellows-Brown was such a\ncustomer.\nElspeth, the forewoman of the workroom, came down\nwith the frock and Sybil pulled it over Mrs Fellows-Brown\u2019s\nhead.\n\u2018There,\u2019 she said, \u2018I think it\u2019s good. Yes, it\u2019s de\ufb01nitely a\nsuccess.\u2019\nMrs Fellows-Brown turned sideways and looked in the\nmirror.\n\u2018I must say,\u2019 she said, \u2018your clothes do do something to\nmy behind.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re much thinner than you were three months ago,\u2019\nSybil assured her.\n\u2018I\u2019m really not,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-Brown, \u2018though I must\nsay I look it in this. There\u2019s something about the way you\n\n----Page Break----\ncut, it really does minimize my behind. I almost look as\nthough I hadn\u2019t got one\u2014I mean only the usual kind that\nmost people have.\u2019 She sighed and gingerly smoothed the\ntroublesome portion of her anatomy. \u2018It\u2019s always been a bit\nof a trial to me,\u2019 she said. \u2018Of course, for years I could pull it\nin, you know, by sticking out my front. Well, I can\u2019t do that\nany longer because I\u2019ve got a stomach now as well as a\nbehind. And I mean\u2014well, you can\u2019t pull it in both ways, can\nyou?\u2019\nAlicia Coombe said, \u2018You should see some of my\ncustomers!\u2019\nMrs Fellows-Brown experimented to and fro.\n\u2018A stomach is worse than a behind,\u2019 she said. \u2018It shows\nmore. Or perhaps you think it does, because, I mean, when\nyou\u2019re talking to people you\u2019re facing them and that\u2019s the\nmoment they can\u2019t see your behind but they can notice\nyour stomach. Anyway, I\u2019ve made it a rule to pull in my\nstomach and let my behind look after itself.\u2019 She craned her\nneck round still farther, then said suddenly, \u2018Oh, that doll of\nyours! She gives me the creeps. How long have you had\nher?\u2019\nSybil glanced uncertainly at Alicia Coombe, who looked\npuzzled but vaguely distressed.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know exactly\u2026some time I think\u2014I never can\nremember things. It\u2019s awful nowadays\u2014I simply cannot\nremember. Sybil, how long have we had her?\u2019\nSybil said shortly, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-Brown, \u2018she gives me the creeps.\nUncanny! She looks, you know, as though she was watching\nus all, and perhaps laughing in that velvet sleeve of hers. I\u2019d\n\n----Page Break----\nget rid of her if I were you.\u2019 She gave a little shiver, then she\nplunged once more into dress-making details. Should she or\nshould she not have the sleeves an inch shorter? And what\nabout the length? When all these important points were\nsettled satisfactorily, Mrs Fellows-Brown resumed her own\ngarments and prepared to leave. As she passed the doll, she\nturned her head again.\n\u2018No,\u2019 she said, \u2018I don\u2019t like that doll. She looks too much\nas though she belonged here. It isn\u2019t healthy.\u2019\n\u2018Now what did she mean by that?\u2019 demanded Sybil, as\nMrs Fellows-Brown departed down the stairs.\nBefore Alicia Coombe could answer, Mrs Fellows-Brown\nreturned, poking her head round the door.\n\u2018Good gracious, I forgot all about Fou-Ling. Where are\nyou, ducksie? Well, I never!\u2019\nShe stared and the other two women stared, too. The\nPekinese was sitting by the green-velvet chair, staring up at\nthe limp doll sprawled on it. There was no expression, either\nof pleasure or resentment, on his small, pop-eyed face. He\nwas merely looking.\n\u2018Come along, mum\u2019s darling,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-Brown.\nMum\u2019s darling paid no attention whatever.\n\u2018He gets more disobedient every day,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-\nBrown, with the air of one cataloguing a virtue. \u2018Come on,\nFou-Ling. Dindins. Lu\ufb04y liver.\u2019\nFou-Ling turned his head about an inch and a half\ntowards his mistress, then with disdain resumed his\nappraisal of the doll.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018She\u2019s certainly made an impression on him,\u2019 said Mrs\nFellows-Brown. \u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever noticed her before. I\nhaven\u2019t either. Was she here last time I came?\u2019\nThe other two women looked at each other. Sybil now\nhad a frown on her face, and Alicia Coombe said, wrinkling\nup her forehead, \u2018I told you\u2014I simply can\u2019t remember\nanything nowadays. How long have we had her, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018Where did she come from?\u2019 demanded Mrs Fellows-\nBrown. \u2018Did you buy her?\u2019\n\u2018Oh no.\u2019 Somehow Alicia Coombe was shocked at the\nidea. \u2018Oh no. I suppose\u2014I suppose someone gave her to\nme.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018Maddening!\u2019 she exclaimed.\n\u2018Absolutely maddening, when everything goes out of your\nhead the very moment after it\u2019s happened.\u2019\n\u2018Now don\u2019t be stupid, Fou-Ling,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-Brown\nsharply. \u2018Come on. I\u2019ll have to pick you up.\u2019\nShe picked him up. Fou-Ling uttered a short bark of\nagonized protest. They went out of the room with Fou-Ling\u2019s\npop-eyed face turned over his \ufb02u\ufb00y shoulder, still staring\nwith enormous attention at the doll on the chair\u2026\n\u2018That there doll,\u2019 said Mrs Groves, \u2018fair gives me the\ncreeps, it does.\u2019\nMrs Groves was the cleaner. She had just \ufb01nished a\ncrablike progress backwards along the \ufb02oor. Now she was\nstanding up and working slowly round the room with a\nduster.\n\u2018Funny thing,\u2019 said Mrs Groves, \u2018never noticed it really\nuntil yesterday. And then it hit me all of a sudden, as you\nmight say.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You don\u2019t like it?\u2019 asked Sybil.\n\u2018I tell you, Mrs Fox, it gives me the creeps,\u2019 said the\ncleaning woman. \u2018It ain\u2019t natural, if you know what I mean.\nAll those long hanging legs and the way she\u2019s slouched\ndown there and the cunning look she has in her eye. It\ndoesn\u2019t look healthy, that\u2019s what I say.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve never said anything about her before,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018I tell you, I never noticed her\u2014not till this morning\u2026 Of\ncourse I know she\u2019s been here some time but\u2014\u2019 She\nstopped and a puzzled expression \ufb02itted across her face.\n\u2018Sort of thing you might dream of at night,\u2019 she said, and\ngathering up various cleaning implements she departed\nfrom the \ufb01tting-room and walked across the landing to the\nroom on the other side.\nSybil stared at the relaxed doll. An expression of\nbewilderment was growing on her face. Alicia Coombe\nentered and Sybil turned sharply.\n\u2018Miss Coombe, how long have you had this creature?\u2019\n\u2018What, the doll? My dear, you know I can\u2019t remember\nthings. Yesterday\u2014why, it\u2019s too silly!\u2014I was going out to\nthat lecture and I hadn\u2019t gone halfway down the street when\nI suddenly found I couldn\u2019t remember where I was going. I\nthought and I thought. Finally I told myself it must be\nFortnums. I knew there was something I wanted to get at\nFortnums. Well, you won\u2019t believe me, it wasn\u2019t till I actually\ngot home and was having some tea that I remembered\nabout the lecture. Of course, I\u2019ve always heard that people\ngo gaga as they get on in life, but it\u2019s happening to me\nmuch too fast. I\u2019ve forgotten now where I\u2019ve put my\nhandbag\u2014and my spectacles, too. Where did I put those\n\n----Page Break----\nspectacles? I had them just now\u2014I was reading something\nin The Times.\u2019\n\u2018The spectacles are on the mantelpiece here,\u2019 said Sybil,\nhanding them to her. \u2018How did you get the doll? Who gave\nher to you?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s a blank, too,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018Somebody\ngave her to me or sent her to me, I suppose\u2026However, she\ndoes seem to match the room very well, doesn\u2019t she?\u2019\n\u2018Rather too well, I think,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018Funny thing is, I\ncan\u2019t remember when I \ufb01rst noticed her here.\u2019\n\u2018Now don\u2019t you get the same way as I am,\u2019 Alicia Coombe\nadmonished her. \u2018After all, you\u2019re young still.\u2019\n\u2018But really, Miss Coombe, I don\u2019t remember. I mean, I\nlooked at her yesterday and thought there was something\u2014\nwell, Mrs Groves is quite right\u2014something creepy about her.\nAnd then I thought I\u2019d already thought so, and then I tried to\nremember when I \ufb01rst thought so, and\u2014well, I just couldn\u2019t\nremember anything! In a way, it was as if I\u2019d never seen her\nbefore\u2014only it didn\u2019t feel like that. It felt as though she\u2019d\nbeen here a long time but I\u2019d only just noticed her.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps she \ufb02ew in through the window one day on a\nbroomstick,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018Anyway, she belongs here\nnow all right.\u2019 She looked round. \u2018You could hardly imagine\nthe room without her, could you?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Sybil, with a slight shiver, \u2018but I rather wish I\ncould.\u2019\n\u2018Could what?\u2019\n\u2018Imagine the room without her.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Are we all going barmy about this doll?\u2019 demanded Alicia\nCoombe impatiently. \u2018What\u2019s wrong with the poor thing?\nLooks like a decayed cabbage to me, but perhaps,\u2019 she\nadded, \u2018that\u2019s because I haven\u2019t got spectacles on.\u2019 She put\nthem on her nose and looked \ufb01rmly at the doll. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she\nsaid, \u2018I see what you mean. She is a little creepy\u2026Sad-\nlooking but\u2014well, sly and rather determined, too.\u2019\n\u2018Funny,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018Mrs Fellows-Brown taking such a\nviolent dislike to her.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s one who never minds speaking her mind,\u2019 said\nAlicia Coombe.\n\u2018But it\u2019s odd,\u2019 persisted Sybil, \u2018that this doll should make\nsuch an impression on her.\u2019\n\u2018Well, people do take dislikes very suddenly sometimes.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Sybil with a little laugh, \u2018that doll never\nwas here until yesterday\u2026Perhaps she just\u2014\ufb02ew in through\nthe window, as you say, and settled herself here.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said\nAlicia Coombe, \u2018I\u2019m sure she\u2019s been here some time.\nPerhaps she only became visible yesterday.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what I feel, too,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018that she\u2019s been here\nsome time\u2026but all the same I don\u2019t remember really seeing\nher till yesterday.\u2019\n\u2018Now, dear,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe briskly, \u2018do stop it. You\u2019re\nmaking me feel quite peculiar with shivers running up and\ndown my spine. You\u2019re not going to work up a great deal of\nsupernatural hoo-hah about that creature, are you?\u2019 She\npicked up the doll, shook it out, rearranged its shoulders,\nand sat it down again on another chair. Immediately the doll\n\ufb02opped slightly and relaxed.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018It\u2019s not a bit lifelike,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, staring at the\ndoll. \u2018And yet, in a funny way, she does seem alive, doesn\u2019t\nshe?\u2019\nII\n\u2018Oo, it did give me a turn,\u2019 said Mrs Groves, as she went\nround the showroom, dusting. \u2018Such a turn as I hardly like to\ngo into the \ufb01tting-room any more.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s given you a turn?\u2019 demanded Miss Coombe who\nwas sitting at a writing-table in the corner, busy with various\naccounts. \u2018This woman,\u2019 she added more for her own bene\ufb01t\nthan that of Mrs Groves, \u2018thinks she can have two evening\ndresses, three cocktail dresses, and a suit every year\nwithout ever paying me a penny for them! Really, some\npeople!\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s that doll,\u2019 said Mrs Groves.\n\u2018What, our doll again?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, sitting up there at the desk, like a human. Oo, it\ndidn\u2019t half give me a turn!\u2019\n\u2018What are you talking about?\u2019\nAlicia Coombe got up, strode across the room, across the\nlanding outside, and into the room opposite\u2014the \ufb01tting-\nroom. There was a small Sheraton desk in one corner of it,\nand there, sitting in a chair drawn up to it, her long \ufb02oppy\narms on the desk, sat the doll.\n\u2018Sombody seems to have been having fun,\u2019 said Alicia\nCoombe. \u2018Fancy sitting her up like that. Really, she looks\nquite natural.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nSybil Fox came down the stairs at this moment, carrying\na dress that was to be tried on that morning.\n\u2018Come here, Sybil. Look at our doll sitting at my private\ndesk and writing letters now.\u2019\nThe two women looked.\n\u2018Really,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018it\u2019s too ridiculous! I wonder\nwho propped her up there. Did you?\u2019\n\u2018No, I didn\u2019t,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018It must have been one of the\ngirls from upstairs.\u2019\n\u2018A silly sort of joke, really,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. She\npicked up the doll from the desk and threw her back on the\nsofa.\nSybil laid the dress over a chair carefully, then she went\nout and up the stairs to the workroom.\n\u2018You know the doll,\u2019 she said, \u2018the velvet doll in Miss\nCoombe\u2019s room downstairs\u2014in the \ufb01tting room?\u2019\nThe forewoman and three girls looked up.\n\u2018Yes, miss, of course we know.\u2019\n\u2018Who sat her up at the desk this morning for a joke?\u2019\nThe three girls looked at her, then Elspeth, the\nforewoman, said, \u2018Sat her up at the desk? I didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018Nor did I,\u2019 said one of the girls. \u2018Did you, Marlene?\u2019\nMarlene shook her head.\n\u2018This your bit of fun, Elspeth?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018No, indeed,\u2019 said Elspeth, a stern woman who looked as\nthough her mouth should always be \ufb01lled with pins. \u2018I\u2019ve\nmore to do than going about playing with dolls and sitting\nthem up at desks.\u2019\n\u2018Look here,\u2019 said Sybil, and to her surprise her voice\nshook slightly. \u2018It was\u2014it was quite a good joke, only I\u2019d just\nlike to know who did it.\u2019\nThe three girls bristled.\n\u2018We\u2019ve told you, Mrs Fox. None of us did it, did we,\nMarlene?\u2019\n\u2018I didn\u2019t,\u2019 said Marlene, \u2018and if Nellie and Margaret say\nthey didn\u2019t, well then, none of us did.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve heard what I had to say,\u2019 said Elspeth. \u2018What\u2019s\nthis all about anyway, Mrs Fox?\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps it was Mrs Groves?\u2019 said Marlene.\nSybil shook her head. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be Mrs Groves. It gave\nher quite a turn.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll come down and see for myself,\u2019 said Elspeth.\n\u2018She\u2019s not there now,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018Miss Coombe took her\naway from the desk and threw her back on the sofa. Well\u2014\u2019\nshe paused\u2014\u2018what I mean is, someone must have stuck her\nup there in the chair at the writing-desk\u2014thinking it was\nfunny. I suppose. And\u2014and I don\u2019t see why they won\u2019t say\nso.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve told you twice, Mrs Fox,\u2019 said Margaret. \u2018I don\u2019t see\nwhy you should go on accusing us of telling lies. None of us\nwould do a silly thing like that.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. But\u2014\nbut who else could possibly have done it?\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps she got up and walked there herself,\u2019 said\nMarlene, and giggled.\nFor some reason Sybil didn\u2019t like the suggestion.\n\u2018Oh, it\u2019s all a lot of nonsense, anyway,\u2019 she said, and\nwent down the stairs again.\nAlicia Coombe was humming quite cheerfully. She looked\nround the room.\n\u2018I\u2019ve lost my spectacles again,\u2019 she said, \u2018but it doesn\u2019t\nreally matter. I don\u2019t want to see anything this moment. The\ntrouble is, of course, when you\u2019re as blind as I am, that\nwhen you have lost your spectacles, unless you\u2019ve got\nanother pair to put on and \ufb01nd them with, well, then you\ncan\u2019t \ufb01nd them because you can\u2019t see to \ufb01nd them.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll look round for you,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018You had them just\nnow.\u2019\n\u2018I went into the other room when you went upstairs. I\nexpect I took them back in there.\u2019\nShe went across to the other room.\n\u2018It\u2019s such a bother,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018I want to get on\nwith these accounts. How can I if I haven\u2019t my spectacles?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll go up and get your second pair from the bedroom,\u2019\nsaid Sybil.\n\u2018I haven\u2019t a second pair at present,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\n\u2018Why, what\u2019s happened to them?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, I think I left them yesterday when I was out at\nlunch. I\u2019ve rung up there, and I\u2019ve rung up the two shops I\nwent into, too.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, dear,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018you\u2019ll have to get three pairs, I\nsuppose.\u2019\n\u2018If I had three pairs of spectacles,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018I\nshould spend my whole life looking for one or the other of\nthem. I really think it\u2019s best to have only one. Then you\u2019ve\ngot to look till you \ufb01nd it.\u2019\n\u2018Well, they must be somewhere,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018You haven\u2019t\nbeen out of these two rooms. They\u2019re certainly not here, so\nyou must have laid them down in the \ufb01tting-room.\u2019\nShe went back, walking round, looking quite closely.\nFinally, as a last idea, she took up the doll from the sofa.\n\u2018I\u2019ve got them,\u2019 she called.\n\u2018Oh, where were they, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018Under our precious doll. I suppose you must have thrown\nthem down when you put her back on the sofa.\u2019\n\u2018I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 said Sybil with exasperation. \u2018Then I suppose the\ndoll took them and was hiding them from you!\u2019\n\u2018Really, you know,\u2019 said Alicia, looking thoughtfully at the\ndoll, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t put it past her. She looks very intelligent,\ndon\u2019t you think, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think I like her face,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018She looks as\nthough she knew something that we didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You don\u2019t think she looks sort of sad and sweet?\u2019 said\nAlicia Coombe pleadingly, but without conviction.\n\u2018I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in the least sweet,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018No\u2026perhaps you\u2019re right\u2026Oh, well, let\u2019s get on with\nthings. Lady Lee will be here in another ten minutes. I just\nwant to get these invoices done and posted.\u2019\nIII\n\u2018Mrs Fox. Mrs Fox?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, Margaret?\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018What is it?\u2019\nSybil was busy leaning over a table, cutting a piece of\nsatin material.\n\u2018Oh, Mrs Fox, it\u2019s that doll again. I took down the brown\ndress like you said, and there\u2019s that doll sitting up at the\ndesk again. And it wasn\u2019t me\u2014it wasn\u2019t any of us. Please,\nMrs Fox, we really wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u2019\nSybil\u2019s scissors slid a little.\n\u2018There,\u2019 she said angrily, \u2018look what you\u2019ve made me do.\nOh, well, it\u2019ll be all right, I suppose. Now, what\u2019s this about\nthe doll?\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s sitting at the desk again.\u2019\nSybil went down and walked into the \ufb01tting-room. The\ndoll was sitting at the desk exactly as she had sat there\nbefore.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You\u2019re very determined, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 said Sybil, speaking\nto the doll.\nShe picked her up unceremoniously and put her back on\nthe sofa.\n\u2018That\u2019s your place, my girl,\u2019 she said. \u2018You stay there.\u2019\nShe walked across to the other room.\n\u2018Miss Coombe.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018Somebody is having a game with us, you know. That doll\nwas sitting at the desk again.\u2019\n\u2018Who do you think it is?\u2019\n\u2018It must be one of those three upstairs,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018Thinks it\u2019s funny, I suppose. Of course they all swear to\nhigh heaven it wasn\u2019t them.\u2019\n\u2018Who do you think it is\u2014Margaret?\u2019\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Margaret. She looked quite queer\nwhen she came in and told me. I expect it\u2019s that giggling\nMarlene.\u2019\n\u2018Anyway, it\u2019s a very silly thing to do.\u2019\n\u2018Of course it is\u2014idiotic,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018However,\u2019 she added\ngrimly, \u2018I\u2019m going to put a stop to it.\u2019\n\u2018What are you going to do?\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll see,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\n----Page Break----\nThat night when she left, she locked the \ufb01tting-room from\nthe outside.\n\u2018I\u2019m locking this door,\u2019 she said, \u2018and I\u2019m taking the key\nwith me.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, I see,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, with a faint air of\namusement. \u2018You\u2019re beginning to think it\u2019s me, are you? You\nthink I\u2019m so absent-minded that I go in there and think I\u2019ll\nwrite at the desk, but instead I pick the doll up and put her\nthere to write for me. Is that the idea? And then I forget all\nabout it?\u2019\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s a possibility,\u2019 Sybil admitted. \u2018Anyway, I\u2019m\ngoing to be quite sure that no silly practical joke is played\ntonight.\u2019\nThe following morning, her lips set grimly, the \ufb01rst thing\nSybil did on arrival was to unlock the door of the \ufb01tting-\nroom and march in. Mrs Groves, with an aggrieved\nexpression and mop and duster in hand, had been waiting\non the landing.\n\u2018Now we\u2019ll see!\u2019 said Sybil.\nThen she drew back with a slight gasp.\nThe doll was sitting at the desk.\n\u2018Coo!\u2019 said Mrs Groves behind her. \u2018It\u2019s uncanny! That\u2019s\nwhat it is. Oh, there, Mrs Fox, you look quite pale, as though\nyou\u2019ve come over queer. You need a little drop of\nsomething. Has Miss Coombe got a drop upstairs, do you\nknow?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m quite all right,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\n----Page Break----\nShe walked over to the doll, lifted her carefully, and\ncrossed the room with her.\n\u2018Somebody\u2019s been playing a trick on you again,\u2019 said Mrs\nGroves.\n\u2018I don\u2019t see how they could have played a trick on me\nthis time,\u2019 said Sybil slowly. \u2018I locked that door last night. You\nknow yourself that no one could get in.\u2019\n\u2018Somebody\u2019s got another key, maybe,\u2019 said Mrs Groves\nhelpfully.\n\u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018We\u2019ve never bothered to\nlock this door before. It\u2019s one of those old-fashioned keys\nand there\u2019s only one of them.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps the other key \ufb01ts it\u2014the one to the door\nopposite.\u2019\nIn due course they tried all the keys in the shop, but\nnone \ufb01tted the door of the \ufb01tting-room.\n\u2018It is odd, Miss Coombe,\u2019 said Sybil later, as they were\nhaving lunch together.\nAlicia Coombe was looking rather pleased.\n\u2018My dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018I think it\u2019s simply extraordinary. I\nthink we ought to write to the psychical research people\nabout it. You know, they might send an investigator\u2014a\nmedium or someone\u2014to see if there\u2019s anything peculiar\nabout the room.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t seem to mind at all,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, I rather enjoy it in a way,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018I\nmean, at my age, it\u2019s rather fun when things happen! All the\nsame\u2014no,\u2019 she added thoughtfully. \u2018I don\u2019t think I do quite\nlike it. I mean, that doll\u2019s getting rather above herself, isn\u2019t\nshe?\u2019\nOn that evening Sybil and Alicia Coombe locked the door\nonce more on the outside.\n\u2018I still think,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018that somebody might be playing\na practical joke, though, really, I don\u2019t see why\u2026\u2019\n\u2018Do you think she\u2019ll be at the desk again tomorrow\nmorning?\u2019 demanded Alicia.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018I do.\u2019\nBut they were wrong. The doll was not at the desk.\nInstead, she was on the window sill, looking out into the\nstreet. And again there was an extraordinary naturalness\nabout her position.\n\u2018It\u2019s all frightfully silly, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, as\nthey were snatching a quick cup of tea that afternoon. By\ncommon consent they were not having it in the \ufb01tting-room,\nas they usually did, but in Alicia Coombe\u2019s own room\nopposite.\n\u2018Silly in what way?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I mean, there\u2019s nothing you can get hold of. Just a\ndoll that\u2019s always in a di\ufb00erent place.\u2019\nAs day followed day it seemed a more and more apt\nobservation. It was not only at night that the doll now\nmoved. At any moment when they came into the \ufb01tting-\nroom, after they had been absent even a few minutes, they\n\n----Page Break----\nmight \ufb01nd the doll in a di\ufb00erent place. They could have left\nher on the sofa and \ufb01nd her on a chair. Then she\u2019d be on a\ndi\ufb00erent chair. Sometimes she\u2019d be in the window seat,\nsometimes at the desk again.\n\u2018She just moves about as she likes,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\n\u2018And I think, Sybil, I think it\u2019s amusing her.\u2019\nThe two women stood looking down at the inert\nsprawling \ufb01gure in its limp, soft velvet, with its painted silk\nface.\n\u2018Some old bits of velvet and silk and a lick of paint, that\u2019s\nall it is,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. Her voice was strained. \u2018I\nsuppose, you know, we could\u2014er\u2014we could dispose of her.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean, dispose of her?\u2019 asked Sybil. Her\nvoice sounded almost shocked.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018we could put her in the \ufb01re, if\nthere was a \ufb01re. Burn her, I mean, like a witch\u2026Or of\ncourse,\u2019 she added matter-of-factly, \u2018we could just put her in\nthe dustbin.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think that would do,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018Somebody would\nprobably take her out of the dustbin and bring her back to\nus.\u2019\n\u2018Or we could send her somewhere,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\n\u2018You know, to one of those societies who are always writing\nand asking for something\u2014for a sale or a bazaar. I think\nthat\u2019s the best idea.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018I\u2019d be almost afraid to do\nthat.\u2019\n\u2018Afraid?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, I think she\u2019d come back,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018You mean, she\u2019d come back here?\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Like a homing pigeon?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, that\u2019s what I mean.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose we\u2019re not going o\ufb00 our heads, are we?\u2019 said\nAlicia Coombe. \u2018Perhaps I\u2019ve really gone gaga and perhaps\nyou\u2019re just humouring me, is that it?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018But I\u2019ve got a nasty frightening feeling\u2014\na horrid feeling that she\u2019s too strong for us.\u2019\n\u2018What? That mess of rags?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, that horrible limp mess of rags. Because, you see,\nshe\u2019s so determined.\u2019\n\u2018Determined?\u2019\n\u2018To have her own way! I mean, this is her room now!\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, looking round, \u2018it is, isn\u2019t it? Of\ncourse, it always was, when you come to think of it\u2014the\ncolours and everything\u2026I thought she \ufb01tted in here, but it\u2019s\nthe room that \ufb01ts her. I must say,\u2019 added the dressmaker,\nwith a touch of briskness in her voice, \u2018it\u2019s rather absurd\nwhen a doll comes and takes possession of things like this.\nYou know, Mrs Groves won\u2019t come in here any longer and\nclean.\u2019\n\u2018Does she say she\u2019s frightened of the doll?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018No. She just makes excuses of some kind or other.\u2019 Then\nAlicia added with a hint of panic, \u2018What are we going to do,\nSybil? It\u2019s getting me down, you know. I haven\u2019t been able\nto design anything for weeks.\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t keep my mind on cutting out properly,\u2019 Sybil\nconfessed. \u2018I make all sorts of silly mistakes. Perhaps,\u2019 she\nsaid uncertainly, \u2018your idea of writing to the psychical\nresearch people might do some good.\u2019\n\u2018Just make us look like a couple of fools,\u2019 said Alicia\nCoombe. \u2018I didn\u2019t seriously mean it. No, I suppose we\u2019ll just\nhave to go on until\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Until what?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Alicia, and she laughed\nuncertainly.\nOn the following day Sybil, when she arrived, found the\ndoor of the \ufb01tting-room locked.\n\u2018Miss Coombe, have you got the key? Did you lock this\nlast night?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018I locked it and it\u2019s going to\nstay locked.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\u2018I just mean I\u2019ve given up the room. The doll can have it.\nWe don\u2019t need two rooms. We can \ufb01t in here.\u2019\n\u2018But it\u2019s your own private sitting-room.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I don\u2019t want it any more. I\u2019ve got a very nice\nbedroom. I can make a bed-sitting room out of that, can\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Do you mean you\u2019re really not going into that \ufb01tting-\nroom ever again?\u2019 said Sybil incredulously.\n\u2018That\u2019s exactly what I mean.\u2019\n\u2018But\u2014what about cleaning? It\u2019ll get in a terrible state.\u2019\n\u2018Let it!\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018If this place is su\ufb00ering from\nsome kind of possession by a doll, all right\u2014let her keep\npossession. And clean the room herself.\u2019 And she added,\n\u2018She hates us, you know.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018The doll hates us?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Alicia. \u2018Didn\u2019t you know? You must have\nknown. You must have seen it when you looked at her.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Sybil thoughtfully, \u2018I suppose I did. I suppose I\nfelt that all along\u2014that she hated us and wanted to get us\nout of there.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s a malicious little thing,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\n\u2018Anyway, she ought to be satis\ufb01ed now.\u2019\nThings went on rather more peacefully after that. Alicia\nCoombe announced to her sta\ufb00 that she was giving up the\nuse of the \ufb01tting-room for the present\u2014it made too many\nrooms to dust and clean, she explained.\nBut it hardly helped her to overhear one of the work girls\nsaying to another on the evening of the same day, \u2018She\nreally is batty, Miss Coombe is now. I always thought she\nwas a bit queer\u2014the way she lost things and forgot things.\nBut it\u2019s really beyond anything now, isn\u2019t it? She\u2019s got a sort\nof thing about that doll downstairs.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Ooo, you don\u2019t think she\u2019ll go really bats, do you?\u2019 said\nthe other girl. \u2018That she might knife us or something?\u2019\nThey passed, chattering, and Alicia sat up indignantly in\nher chair. Going bats indeed! Then she added ruefully, to\nherself, \u2018I suppose, if it wasn\u2019t for Sybil, I should think myself\nthat I was going bats. But with me and Sybil and Mrs Groves\ntoo, well, it does look as though there was something in it.\nBut what I don\u2019t see is, how is it going to end?\u2019\nThree weeks later, Sybil said to Alicia Coombe, \u2018We\u2019ve\ngot to go into that room sometimes.\u2019\n\u2018Why?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I mean, it must be in a \ufb01lthy state. Moths will be\ngetting into things, and all that. We ought just to dust and\nsweep it and then lock it up again.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d much rather keep it shut up and not go back in\nthere,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\nSybil said, \u2018Really, you know, you\u2019re even more\nsuperstitious than I am.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose I am,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018I was much more\nready to believe in all this than you were, but to begin with,\nyou know\u2014I\u2014well, I found it exciting in an odd sort of way. I\ndon\u2019t know. I\u2019m just scared, and I\u2019d rather not go into that\nroom again.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I want to,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018and I\u2019m going to.\u2019\n\u2018You know what\u2019s the matter with you?\u2019 said Alicia\nCoombe. \u2018You\u2019re simply curious, that\u2019s all.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018All right, then I\u2019m curious. I want to see what the doll\u2019s\ndone.\u2019\n\u2018I still think it\u2019s much better to leave her alone,\u2019 said\nAlicia. \u2018Now we\u2019ve got out of that room, she\u2019s satis\ufb01ed.\nYou\u2019d better leave her satisi\ufb01ed.\u2019 She gave an exasperated\nsigh. \u2018What nonsense we are talking!\u2019\n\u2018Yes. I know we\u2019re talking nonsense, but if you tell me of\nany way of not talking nonsense\u2014come on, now, give me\nthe key.\u2019\n\u2018All right, all right.\u2019\n\u2018I believe you\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll let her out or something. I\nshould think she was the kind that could pass through doors\nor windows.\u2019\nSybil unlocked the door and went in.\n\u2018How terribly odd,\u2019 she said.\n\u2018What\u2019s odd?\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, peering over her\nshoulder.\n\u2018The room hardly seems dusty at all, does it? You\u2019d think,\nafter being shut up all this time\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Yes, it is odd.\u2019\n\u2018There she is,\u2019 said Sybil.\nThe doll was on the sofa. She was not lying in her usual\nlimp position. She was sitting upright, a cushion behind her\nback. She had the air of the mistress of the house, waiting\nto receive people.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018she seems at home all right,\ndoesn\u2019t she? I almost feel I ought to apologize for coming\nin.\u2019\n\u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 said Sybil.\nShe backed out, pulling the door to, and locked it again.\nThe two women gazed at each other.\n\u2018I wish I knew,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018why it scares us so\nmuch\u2026\u2019\n\u2018My goodness, who wouldn\u2019t be scared?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I mean, what happens, after all? It\u2019s nothing really\n\u2014just a kind of puppet that gets moved around the room. I\nexpect it isn\u2019t the puppet itself\u2014it\u2019s a poltergeist.\u2019\n\u2018Now that is a good idea.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, but I don\u2019t really believe it. I think it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s that doll.\u2019\n\u2018Are you sure you don\u2019t know where she really came\nfrom?\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t the faintest idea,\u2019 said Alicia. \u2018And the more I\nthink of it the more I\u2019m perfectly certain that I didn\u2019t buy\nher, and that nobody gave her to me. I think she\u2014well, she\njust came.\u2019\n\u2018Do you think she\u2019ll\u2014ever go?\u2019\n\u2018Really,\u2019 said Alicia, \u2018I don\u2019t see why she should\u2026She\u2019s\ngot all she wants.\u2019\nBut it seemed that the doll had not got all she wanted.\nThe next day, when Sybil went into the showroom, she drew\n\n----Page Break----\nin her breath with a sudden gasp. Then she called up the\nstairs.\n\u2018Miss Coombe, Miss Coombe, come down here.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019\nAlicia Coombe, who had got up late, came down the\nstairs, hobbling a little precariously for she had rheumatism\nin her right knee.\n\u2018What is the matter with you, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018Look. Look what\u2019s happened now.\u2019\nThey stood in the doorway of the showroom. Sitting on a\nsofa, sprawled easily over the arm of it, was the doll.\n\u2018She\u2019s got out,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018She\u2019s got out of that room!\nShe wants this room as well.\u2019\nAlicia Coombe sat down by the door. \u2018In the end,\u2019 she\nsaid, \u2018I suppose she\u2019ll want the whole shop.\u2019\n\u2018She might,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018You nasty, sly, malicious brute,\u2019 said Alicia, addressing\nthe doll. \u2018Why do you want to come and pester us so? We\ndon\u2019t want you.\u2019\nIt seemed to her, and to Sybil too, that the doll moved\nvery slightly. It was as though its limbs relaxed still further. A\nlong limp arm was lying on the arm of the sofa and the half-\nhidden face looked as if it were peering from under the arm.\nAnd it was a sly, malicious look.\n\u2018Horrible creature,\u2019 said Alicia. \u2018I can\u2019t bear it! I can\u2019t bear\nit any longer.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nSuddenly, taking Sybil completely by surprise, she\ndashed across the room, picked up the doll, ran to the\nwindow, opened it, and \ufb02ung the doll out into the street.\nThere was a gasp and a half cry of fear from Sybil.\n\u2018Oh, Alicia, you shouldn\u2019t have done that! I\u2019m sure you\nshouldn\u2019t have done that!\u2019\n\u2018I had to do something,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018I just\ncouldn\u2019t stand it any more.\u2019\nSybil joined her at the window. Down below on the\npavement the doll lay, loose-limbed, face down.\n\u2018You\u2019ve killed her,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018Don\u2019t be absurd\u2026How can I kill something that\u2019s made\nof velvet and silk, bits and pieces. It\u2019s not real.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s horribly real,\u2019 said Sybil.\nAlicia caught her breath.\n\u2018Good heavens. That child\u2014\u2019\nA small ragged girl was standing over the doll on the\npavement. She looked up and down the street\u2014a street that\nwas not unduly crowded at this time of the morning though\nthere was some automobile tra\ufb03c; then, as though\nsatis\ufb01ed, the child bent, picked up the doll, and ran across\nthe street.\n\u2018Stop, stop!\u2019 called Alicia.\nShe turned to Sybil.\n\u2018That child mustn\u2019t take the doll. She mustn\u2019t! That doll is\ndangerous\u2014it\u2019s evil. We\u2019ve got to stop her.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nIt was not they who stopped her. It was the tra\ufb03c. At that\nmoment three taxis came down one way and two\ntradesmen\u2019s vans in the other direction. The child was\nmarooned on an island in the middle of the road. Sybil\nrushed down the stairs, Alicia Coombe following her.\nDodging between a tradesman\u2019s van and a private car,\nSybil, with Alicia Coombe directly behind her, arrived on the\nisland before the child could get through the tra\ufb03c on the\nopposite side.\n\u2018You can\u2019t take that doll,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018Give her\nback to me.\u2019\nThe child looked at her. She was a skinny little girl about\neight years old, with a slight squint. Her face was de\ufb01ant.\n\u2018Why should I give \u2019er to you?\u2019 she said. \u2018Pitched her out\nof the window, you did\u2014I saw you. If you pushed her out of\nthe window you don\u2019t want her, so now she\u2019s mine.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll buy you another doll,\u2019 said Alicia frantically. \u2018We\u2019ll go\nto a toy shop\u2014anywhere you like\u2014and I\u2019ll buy you the best\ndoll we can \ufb01nd. But give me back this one.\u2019\n\u2018Shan\u2019t,\u2019 said the child.\nHer arms went protectingly round the velvet doll.\n\u2018You must give her back,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018She isn\u2019t yours.\u2019\nShe stretched out to take the doll from the child and at\nthat moment the child stamped her foot, turned, and\nscreamed at them.\n\u2018Shan\u2019t! Shan\u2019t! Shan\u2019t! She\u2019s my very own. I love her.\nYou don\u2019t love her. You hate her. If you didn\u2019t hate her you\n\n----Page Break----\nwouldn\u2019t have pushed her out of the window. I love her, I tell\nyou, and that\u2019s what she wants. She wants to be loved.\u2019\nAnd then like an eel, sliding through the vehicles, the\nchild ran across the street, down an alleyway, and out of\nsight before the two older women could decide to dodge the\ncars and follow.\n\u2018She\u2019s gone,\u2019 said Alicia.\n\u2018She said the doll wanted to be loved,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Alicia, \u2018perhaps that\u2019s what she wanted all\nalong\u2026to be loved\u2026\u2019\nIn the middle of the London tra\ufb03c the two frightened\nwomen stared at each other.\n\n----Page Break----\nIn A Glass Darkly\n\u2018I\u2019ve no explanation of this story. I\u2019ve no theories about the\nwhy and wherefore of it. It\u2019s just a thing\u2014that happened.\nAll the same, I sometimes wonder how things would have\ngone if I\u2019d noticed at the time just that one essential detail\nthat I never appreciated until so many years afterwards. If I\nhad noticed it\u2014well, I suppose the course of three lives\nwould have been entirely altered. Somehow\u2014that\u2019s a very\nfrightening thought.\nFor the beginning of it all, I\u2019ve got to go back to the\nsummer of 1914\u2014just before the war\u2014when I went down to\nBadgeworthy with Neil Carslake. Neil was, I suppose, about\nmy best friend. I\u2019d known his brother Alan too, but not so\nwell. Sylvia, their sister, I\u2019d never met. She was two years\nyounger than Alan and three years younger than Neil. Twice,\nwhile we were at school together, I\u2019d been going to spend\npart of the holidays with Neil at Badgeworthy and twice\nsomething had intervened. So it came about that I was\ntwenty-three when I \ufb01rst saw Neil and Alan\u2019s home.\nWe were to be quite a big party there. Neil\u2019s sister Sylvia\nhad just got engaged to a fellow called Charles Crawley. He\n\n----Page Break----\nwas, so Neil said, a good deal older than she was, but a\nthoroughly decent chap and quite reasonably well-o\ufb00.\nWe arrived, I remember, about seven o\u2019clock in the\nevening. Everyone had gone to his room to dress for dinner.\nNeil took me to mine. Badgeworthy was an attractive,\nrambling old house. It had been added to freely in the last\nthree centuries and was full of little steps up and down, and\nunexpected staircases. It was the sort of house in which it\u2019s\nnot easy to \ufb01nd your way about. I remember Neil promised\nto come and fetch me on his way down to dinner. I was\nfeeling a little shy at the prospect of meeting his people for\nthe \ufb01rst time. I remember saying with a laugh that it was\nthe kind of house one expected to meet ghosts in the\npassages, and he said carelessly that he believed the place\nwas said to be haunted but that none of them had ever seen\nanything, and he didn\u2019t even know what form the ghost was\nsupposed to take.\nThen he hurried away and I set to work to dive into my\nsuitcases for my evening clothes. The Carslakes weren\u2019t\nwell-o\ufb00; they clung on to their old home, but there were no\nmenservants to unpack for you or valet you.\nWell, I\u2019d just got to the stage of tying my tie. I was\nstanding in front of the glass. I could see my own face and\nshoulders and behind them the wall of the room\u2014a plain\nstretch of wall just broken in the middle by a door\u2014and just\nas I \ufb01nally settled my tie I noticed that the door was\nopening.\nI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t turn around\u2014I think that would\nhave been the natural thing to do; anyway, I didn\u2019t. I just\nwatched the door swing slowly open\u2014and as it swung I saw\ninto the room beyond.\n\n----Page Break----\nIt was a bedroom\u2014a larger room than mine\u2014with two\nbedsteads in it, and suddenly I caught my breath.\nFor at the foot of one of those beds was a girl and round\nher neck were a pair of man\u2019s hands and the man was\nslowly forcing her backwards and squeezing her throat as he\ndid so, so that the girl was being slowly su\ufb00ocated.\nThere wasn\u2019t the least possibility of a mistake. What I\nsaw was perfectly clear. What was being done was murder.\nI could see the girl\u2019s face clearly, her vivid golden hair,\nthe agonized terror of her beautiful face, slowly su\ufb00using\nwith blood. Of the man I could see his back, his hands, and a\nscar that ran down the left side of his face towards his neck.\nIt\u2019s taken some time to tell, but in reality only a moment\nor two passed while I stared dumbfounded. Then I wheeled\nround to the rescue\u2026\nAnd on the wall behind me, the wall re\ufb02ected in the\nglass, there was only a Victorian mahogany wardrobe. No\ndoor open\u2014no scene of violence. I swung back to the mirror.\nThe mirror re\ufb02ected only the wardrobe\u2026\nI passed my hands across my eyes. Then I sprang across\nthe room and tried to pull forward the wardrobe and at that\nmoment Neil entered by the other door from the passage\nand asked me what the hell I was trying to do.\nHe must have thought me slightly barmy as I turned on\nhim and demanded whether there was a door behind the\nwardrobe. He said, yes, there was a door, it led into the next\nroom. I asked him who was occupying the next room and he\nsaid people called Oldam\u2014a Major Oldam and his wife. I\nasked him then if Mrs Oldam had very fair hair and when he\nreplied dryly that she was dark I began to realize that I was\n\n----Page Break----\nprobably making a fool of myself. I pulled myself together,\nmade some lame explanation and we went downstairs\ntogether. I told myself that I must have had some kind of\nhallucination\u2014and felt generally rather ashamed and a bit\nof an ass.\nAnd then\u2014and then\u2014Neil said, \u2018My sister Sylvia,\u2019 and I\nwas looking into the lovely face of the girl I had just seen\nbeing su\ufb00ocated to death\u2026and I was introduced to her\n\ufb01anc\u00e9, a tall dark man with a scar down the left side of his\nface.\nWell\u2014that\u2019s that. I\u2019d like you to think and say what you\u2019d\nhave done in my place. Here was the girl\u2014the identical girl\n\u2014and here was the man I\u2019d seen throttling her\u2014and they\nwere to be married in about a month\u2019s time\u2026\nHad I\u2014or had I not\u2014had a prophetic vision of the future?\nWould Sylvia and her husband come down here to stay\nsome time in the future, and be given that room (the best\nspare room) and would that scene I\u2019d witnessed take place\nin grim reality?\nWhat was I to do about it? Could I do anything? Would\nanyone\u2014Neil\u2014or the girl herself\u2014would they believe me?\nI turned the whole business over and over in my mind\nthe week I was down there. To speak or not to speak? And\nalmost at once another complication set in. You see, I fell in\nlove with Sylvia Carslake the \ufb01rst moment I saw here\u2026I\nwanted her more than anything on earth\u2026And in a way that\ntied my hands.\nAnd yet, if I didn\u2019t say anything, Sylvia would marry\nCharles Crawley and Crawley would kill her\u2026\n\n----Page Break----\nAnd so, the day before I left, I blurted it all out to her. I\nsaid I expect she\u2019d think me touched in the intellect or\nsomething, but I swore solemnly that I\u2019d seen the thing just\nas I told it to her and that I felt if she was determined to\nmarry Crawley, I ought to tell her my strange experience.\nShe listened very quietly. There was something in her\neyes I didn\u2019t understand. She wasn\u2019t angry at all. When I\u2019d\n\ufb01nished, she just thanked me gravely. I kept repeating like\nan idiot, \u2018I did see it. I really did see it,\u2019 and she said, \u2018I\u2019m\nsure you did if you say so. I believe you.\u2019\nWell, the upshot was that I went o\ufb00 not knowing whether\nI\u2019d done right or been a fool, and a week later Sylvia broke\no\ufb00 her engagement to Charles Crawley.\nAfter that the war happened, and there wasn\u2019t much\nleisure for thinking of anything else. Once or twice when I\nwas on leave, I came across Sylvia, but as far as possible I\navoided her.\nI loved her and wanted her just as badly as ever, but I\nfelt somehow that it wouldn\u2019t be playing the game. It was\nowing to me that she\u2019d broken o\ufb00 her engagement to\nCrawley, and I kept saying to myself that I could only justify\nthe action I had taken by making my attitude a purely\ndisinterested one.\nThen, in 1916, Neil was killed and it fell to me to tell\nSylvia about his last moments. We couldn\u2019t remain on\nformal footing after that. Sylvia had adored Neil and he had\nbeen my best friend. She was sweet\u2014adorably sweet in her\ngrief. I just managed to hold my tongue and went out again\npraying that a bullet might end the whole miserable\nbusiness. Life without Sylvia wasn\u2019t worth living.\n\n----Page Break----\nBut there was no bullet with my name on it. One nearly\ngot me below the right ear and one was de\ufb02ected by a\ncigarette case in my pocket, but I came through unscathed.\nCharles Crawley was killed in action at the beginning of\n1918.\nSomehow that made a di\ufb00erence. I came home in the\nautumn of 1918 just before the Armistice and I went straight\nto Sylvia and told her that I loved her. I hadn\u2019t much hope\nthat she\u2019d care for me straight away, and you could have\nknocked me down with a feather when she asked me why I\nhadn\u2019t told her sooner. I stammered out something about\nCrawley and she said, \u2018But why did you think I broke it o\ufb00\nwith him?\u2019 and then she told me that she\u2019d fallen in love\nwith me just as I\u2019d done with her\u2014from the very \ufb01rst\nminute.\nI said I thought she\u2019d broken o\ufb00 her engagement\nbecause of the story I told her and she laughed scornfully\nand said that if you loved a man you wouldn\u2019t be as\ncowardly as that, and we went over that old vision of mine\nagain and agreed that it was queer, but nothing more.\n\u2018Well, there\u2019s nothing much to tell for some time after\nthat. Sylvia and I were married and we were very happy. But\nI realized, as soon as she was really mine, that I wasn\u2019t cut\nout for the best kind of husband. I loved Sylvia devotedly,\nbut I was jealous, absurdly jealous of anyone she so much\nas smiled at. It amused her at \ufb01rst, I think she even rather\nliked it. It proved, at least, how devoted I was.\nAs for me, I realized quite fully and unmistakably that I\nwas not only making a fool of myself, but that I was\nendangering all the peace and happiness of our life\ntogether. I knew, I say, but I couldn\u2019t change. Every time\nSylvia got a letter she didn\u2019t show to me I wondered who it\n\n----Page Break----\nwas from. If she laughed and talked with any man, I found\nmyself getting sulky and watchful.\nAt \ufb01rst, as I say, Sylvia laughed at me. She thought it a\nhuge joke. Then she didn\u2019t think the joke so funny. Finally\nshe didn\u2019t think it a joke at all\u2014\nAnd slowly, she began to draw away from me. Not in any\nphysical sense, but she withdrew her secret mind from me. I\nno longer knew what her thoughts were. She was kind\u2014but\nsadly, as thought from a long distance.\nLittle by little I realized that she no longer loved me. Her\nlove had died and it was I who had killed it\u2026\nThe next step was inevitable, I found myself waiting for it\n\u2014dreading it\u2026\nThen Derek Wainwright came into our lives. He had\neverything that I hadn\u2019t. He had brains and a witty tongue.\nHe was good-looking, too, and\u2014I\u2019m forced to admit it\u2014a\nthoroughly good chap. As soon as I saw him I said to myself,\n\u2018This is just the man for Sylvia\u2026\u2019\nShe fought against it. I know she struggled\u2026but I gave\nher no help. I couldn\u2019t. I was entrenched in my gloomy,\nsullen reserve. I was su\ufb00ering like hell\u2014and I couldn\u2019t\nstretch out a \ufb01nger to save myself. I didn\u2019t help her. I made\nthings worse. I let loose at her one day\u2014a string of savage,\nunwarranted abuse. I was nearly mad with jealousy and\nmisery. The things I said were cruel and untrue and I knew\nwhile I was saying them how cruel and how untrue they\nwere. And yet I took a savage pleasure in saying them\u2026\nI remember how Sylvia \ufb02ushed and shrank\u2026\nI drove her to the edge of endurance.\n\n----Page Break----\nI remember she said, \u2018This can\u2019t go on\u2026\u2019\nWhen I came home that night the house was empty\u2014\nempty. There was a note\u2014quite in the traditional fashion.\nIn it she said that she was leaving me\u2014for good. She was\ngoing down to Badgeworthy for a day or two. After that she\nwas going to the one person who loved her and needed her.\nI was to take that as \ufb01nal.\nI suppose that up to then I hadn\u2019t really believed my own\nsuspicions. This con\ufb01rmation in black and white of my worst\nfears sent me raving mad. I went down to Badgeworthy\nafter her as fast as the car would take me.\nShe had just changed her frock for dinner, I remember,\nwhen I burst into the room. I can see her face\u2014startled\u2014\nbeautiful\u2014afraid.\nI said, \u2018No one but me shall ever have you. No one.\u2019\nAnd I caught her throat in my hands and gripped it and\nbent her backwards.\nSuddenly I saw our re\ufb02ection in the mirror. Sylvia choking\nand myself strangling her, and the scar on my cheek where\nthe bullet grazed it under the right ear.\nNo\u2014I didn\u2019t kill her. That sudden revelation paralysed me\nand I loosened my grasp and let her slip on to the \ufb02oor\u2026\nAnd then I broke down\u2014and she comforted me\u2026Yes, she\ncomforted me.\nI told her everything and she told me that by the phrase\n\u2018the one person who loved and needed her\u2019 she had meant\nher brother Alan\u2026We saw into each other\u2019s hearts that\n\n----Page Break----\nnight, and I don\u2019t think, from that moment, that we ever\ndrifted away from each other again\u2026\nIt\u2019s a sobering thought to go through life with\u2014that, but\nfor the grace of God and a mirror, one might be a\nmurderer\u2026\nOne thing did die that night\u2014the devil of jealousy that\nhad possessed me so long\u2026\nBut I wonder sometimes\u2014suppose I hadn\u2019t made that\ninitial mistake\u2014the scar on the left cheek\u2014when really it\nwas the right\u2014reversed by the mirror\u2026Should I have been\nso sure the man was Charles Crawley? Would I have warned\nSylvia? Would she be married to me\u2014or to him?\nOr are the past and the future all one?\nI\u2019m a simple fellow\u2014and I can\u2019t pretend to understand\nthese things\u2014but I saw what I saw\u2014and because of what I\nsaw, Sylvia and I are together in the old-fashioned words\u2014\ntill death do us part. And perhaps beyond\u2026\n\n----Page Break----\nGreenshaw\u2019s Folly\nI\nThe two men rounded the corner of the shrubbery.\n\u2018Well, there you are,\u2019 said Raymond West. \u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019\nHorace Bindler took a deep, appreciative breath.\n\u2018But my dear,\u2019 he cried, \u2018how wonderful.\u2019 His voice rose in\na high screech of \u00e6sthetic delight, then deepened in\nreverent awe. \u2018It\u2019s unbelievable. Out of this world! A period\npiece of the best.\u2019\n\u2018I \nthought \nyou\u2019d \nlike \nit,\u2019 \nsaid \nRaymond \nWest,\ncomplacently.\n\u2018Like it? My dear\u2014\u2019 Words failed Horace. He unbuckled\nthe strap of his camera and got busy. \u2018This will be one of the\ngems of my collection,\u2019 he said happily. \u2018I do think, don\u2019t\nyou, that it\u2019s rather amusing to have a collection of\nmonstrosities? The idea came to me one night seven years\nago in my bath. My last real gem was in the Campo Santo at\nGenoa, but I really think this beats it. What\u2019s it called?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I haven\u2019t the least idea,\u2019 said Raymond.\n\u2018I suppose it\u2019s got a name?\u2019\n\u2018It must have. But the fact is that it\u2019s never referred to\nround here as anything but Greenshaw\u2019s Folly.\u2019\n\u2018Greenshaw being the man who built it?\u2019\n\u2018Yes. In eighteen-sixty or seventy or thereabouts. The\nlocal success story of the time. Barefoot boy who had risen\nto immense prosperity. Local opinion is divided as to why he\nbuilt this house, whether it was sheer exuberance of wealth\nor whether it was done to impress his creditors. If the latter,\nit didn\u2019t impress them. He either went bankrupt or the next\nthing to it. Hence the name, Greenshaw\u2019s Folly.\u2019\nHorace\u2019s camera clicked. \u2018There,\u2019 he said in a satis\ufb01ed\nvoice. \u2018Remind me to show you No. 310 in my collection. A\nreally incredible marble mantelpiece in the Italian manner.\u2019\nHe added, looking at the house, \u2018I can\u2019t conceive of how Mr\nGreenshaw thought of it all.\u2019\n\u2018Rather obvious in some ways,\u2019 said Raymond. \u2018He had\nvisited the cha^teaux of the Loire, don\u2019t you think? Those\nturrets. And then, rather unfortunately, he seems to have\ntravelled in the Orient. The in\ufb02uence of the Taj Mahal is\nunmistakable. I rather like the Moorish wing,\u2019 he added, \u2018and\nthe traces of a Venetian palace.\u2019\n\u2018One wonders how he ever got hold of an architect to\ncarry out these ideas.\u2019\nRaymond shrugged his shoulders.\n\u2018No di\ufb03culty about that, I expect,\u2019 he said. \u2018Probably the\narchitect retired with a good income for life while poor old\n\n----Page Break----\nGreenshaw went bankrupt.\u2019\n\u2018Could we look at it from the other side?\u2019 asked Horace,\n\u2018or are we trespassing!\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019re trespassing all right,\u2019 said Raymond, \u2018but I don\u2019t\nthink it will matter.\u2019\nHe turned towards the corner of the house and Horace\nskipped after him.\n\u2018But who lives here, my dear? Orphans or holiday\nvisitors? It can\u2019t be a school. No playing-\ufb01elds or brisk\ne\ufb03ciency.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, a Greenshaw lives here still,\u2019 said Raymond over his\nshoulder. \u2018The house itself didn\u2019t go in the crash. Old\nGreenshaw\u2019s son inherited it. He was a bit of a miser and\nlived here in a corner of it. Never spent a penny. Probably\nnever had a penny to spend. His daughter lives here now.\nOld lady\u2014very eccentric.\u2019\nAs he spoke Raymond was congratulating himself on\nhaving thought of Greenshaw\u2019s Folly as a means of\nentertaining \nhis \nguest. \nThese \nliterary \ncritics \nalways\nprofessed themselves as longing for a week-end in the\ncountry, and were wont to \ufb01nd the country extremely boring\nwhen they got there. Tomorrow there would be the Sunday\npapers, and for today Raymond West congratulated himself\non suggesting a visit to Greenshaw\u2019s Folly to enrich Horace\nBindler\u2019s well-known collection of monstrosities.\nThey turned the corner of the house and came out on a\nneglected lawn. In one corner of it was a large arti\ufb01cial\nrockery, and bending over it was a \ufb01gure at sight of which\nHorace clutched Raymond delightedly by the arm.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018My dear,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018do you see what she\u2019s got on?\nA sprigged print dress. Just like a housemaid\u2014when there\nwere housemaids. One of my most cherished memories is\nstaying at a house in the country when I was quite a boy\nwhere a real housemaid called you in the morning, all\ncrackling in a print dress and a cap. Yes, my boy, really\u2014a\ncap. Muslin with streamers. No, perhaps it was the parlour-\nmaid who had the streamers. But anyway she was a real\nhousemaid and she brought in an enormous brass can of hot\nwater. What an exciting day we\u2019re having.\u2019\nThe \ufb01gure in the print dress had straightened up and had\nturned towards them, trowel in hand. She was a su\ufb03ciently\nstartling \ufb01gure. Unkempt locks of iron-grey fell wispily on\nher shoulders, a straw hat rather like the hats that horses\nwear in Italy was crammed down on her head. The coloured\nprint dress she wore fell nearly to her ankles. Out of a\nweatherbeaten, not-too-clean face, shrewd eyes surveyed\nthem appraisingly.\n\u2018I must apologize for trespassing, Miss Greenshaw,\u2019 said\nRaymond West, as he advanced towards her, \u2018but Mr Horace\nBindler who is staying with me\u2014\u2019\nHorace bowed and removed his hat.\n\u2018\u2014is most interested in\u2014er\u2014ancient history and\u2014er\u2014\n\ufb01ne buildings.\u2019\nRaymond West spoke with the ease of a well-known\nauthor who knows that he is a celebrity, that he can venture\nwhere other people may not.\nMiss Greenshaw looked up at the sprawling exuberance\nbehind her.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018It is a \ufb01ne house,\u2019 she said appreciatively. \u2018My\ngrandfather built it\u2014before my time, of course. He is\nreported as having said that he wished to astonish the\nnatives.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll say he did that, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Horace Bindler.\n\u2018Mr Bindler is the well-known literary critic,\u2019 said\nRaymond West.\nMiss Greenshaw had clearly no reverence for literary\ncritics. She remained unimpressed.\n\u2018I consider it,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw, referring to the\nhouse, \u2018as a monument to my grandfather\u2019s genius. Silly\nfools come here, and ask me why I don\u2019t sell it and go and\nlive in a \ufb02at. What would I do in a \ufb02at? It\u2019s my home and I\nlive in it,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw. \u2018Always have lived here.\u2019\nShe considered, brooding over the past. \u2018There were three\nof us. Laura married the curate. Papa wouldn\u2019t give her any\nmoney, said clergymen ought to be unworldly. She died,\nhaving a baby. Baby died too. Nettie ran away with the\nriding master. Papa cut her out of his will, of course.\nHandsome fellow, Harry Fletcher, but no good. Don\u2019t think\nNettie was happy with him. Anyway, she didn\u2019t live long.\nThey had a son. He writes to me sometimes, but of course\nhe isn\u2019t a Greenshaw. I\u2019m the last of the Greenshaws.\u2019 She\ndrew up her bent shoulders with a certain pride, and\nreadjusted the rakish angle of the straw hat. Then, turning,\nshe said sharply,\n\u2018Yes, Mrs Cresswell, what is it?\u2019\nApproaching them from the house was a \ufb01gure that, seen\nside by side with Miss Greenshaw, seemed ludicrously\ndissimilar. Mrs Cresswell had a marvellously dressed head of\nwell-blued hair towering upwards in meticulously arranged\n\n----Page Break----\ncurls and rolls. It was as though she had dressed her head\nto go as a French marquise to a fancy-dressparty. The rest of\nher middle-aged person was dressed in what ought to have\nbeen rustling black silk but was actually one of the shinier\nvarieties of black rayon. Although she was not a large\nwoman, she had a well-developed and sumptuous bust. Her\nvoice when she spoke, was unexpectedly deep. She spoke\nwith exquisite diction, only a slight hesitation over words\nbeginning with \u2018h\u2019 and the \ufb01nal pronunciation of them with\nan exaggerated aspirate gave rise to a suspicion that at\nsome remote period in her youth she might have had\ntrouble over dropping her h\u2019s.\n\u2018The \ufb01sh, madam,\u2019 said Mrs Cresswell, \u2018the slice of cod. It\nhas not arrived. I have asked Alfred to go down for it and he\nrefuses to do so.\u2019\nRather unexpectedly, Miss Greenshaw gave a cackle of\nlaughter.\n\u2018Refuses, does he?\u2019\n\u2018Alfred, madam, has been most disobliging.\u2019\nMiss Greenshaw raised two earth-stained \ufb01ngers to her\nlips, suddenly produced an ear-splitting whistle and at the\nsame time yelled:\n\u2018Alfred. Alfred, come here.\u2019\nRound the corner of the house a young man appeared in\nanswer to the summons, carrying a spade in his hand. He\nhad a bold, handsome face and as he drew near he cast an\nunmistakably malevolent glance towards Mrs Cresswell.\n\u2018You wanted me, miss?\u2019 he said.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Yes, Alfred. I hear you\u2019ve refused to go down for the \ufb01sh.\nWhat about it, eh?\u2019\nAlfred spoke in a surly voice.\n\u2018I\u2019ll go down for it if you wants it, miss. You\u2019ve only got to\nsay.\u2019\n\u2018I do want it. I want it for my supper.\u2019\n\u2018Right you are, miss. I\u2019ll go right away.\u2019\nHe threw an insolent glance at Mrs Cresswell, who\n\ufb02ushed and murmured below her breath:\n\u2018Really! It\u2019s unsupportable.\u2019\n\u2018Now that I think of it,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw, \u2018a couple of\nstrange visitors are just what we need aren\u2019t they, Mrs\nCresswell?\u2019\nMrs Cresswell looked puzzled.\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, madam\u2014\u2019\n\u2018For you-know-what,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw, nodding her\nhead. \u2018Bene\ufb01ciary to a will mustn\u2019t witness it. That\u2019s right,\nisn\u2019t it?\u2019 She appealed to Raymond West.\n\u2018Quite correct,\u2019 said Raymond.\n\u2018I know enough law to know that,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw.\n\u2018And you two are men of standing.\u2019\nShe \ufb02ung down her trowel on her weeding-basket.\n\u2018Would you mind coming up to the library with me?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Delighted,\u2019 said Horace eagerly.\nShe led the way through french windows and through a\nvast yellow and gold drawing-room with faded brocade on\nthe walls and dust covers arranged over the furniture, then\nthrough a large dim hall, up a staircase and into a room on\nthe \ufb01rst \ufb02oor.\n\u2018My grandfather\u2019s library,\u2019 she announced.\nHorace looked round the room with acute pleasure. It\nwas a room, from his point of view, quite full of\nmonstrosities. The heads of sphinxes appeared on the most\nunlikely pieces of furniture, there was a colossal bronze\nrepresenting, he thought, Paul and Virginia, and a vast\nbronze clock with classical motifs of which he longed to take\na photograph.\n\u2018A \ufb01ne lot of books,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw.\nRaymond was already looking at the books. From what\nhe could see from a cursory glance there was no book here\nof any real interest or, indeed, any book which appeared to\nhave been read. They were all superbly bound sets of the\nclassics as supplied ninety years ago for furnishing a\ngentleman\u2019s library. Some novels of a bygone period were\nincluded. But they too showed little signs of having been\nread.\nMiss Greenshaw was fumbling in the drawers of a vast\ndesk. Finally she pulled out a parchment document.\n\u2018My will,\u2019 she explained. \u2018Got to leave your money to\nsomeone\u2014or so they say. If I died without a will I suppose\nthat son of a horse-coper would get it. Handsome fellow,\nHarry Fletcher, but a rogue if there ever was one. Don\u2019t see\nwhy his son should inherit this place. No,\u2019 she went on, as\n\n----Page Break----\nthough answering some unspoken objection, \u2018I\u2019ve made up\nmy mind. I\u2019m leaving it to Cresswell.\u2019\n\u2018Your housekeeper?\u2019\n\u2018Yes. I\u2019ve explained it to her. I make a will leaving her all\nI\u2019ve got and then I don\u2019t need to pay her any wages. Saves\nme a lot in current expenses, and it keeps her up to the\nmark. No giving me notice and walking o\ufb00 at any minute.\nVery la-di-dah and all that, isn\u2019t she? But her father was a\nworking plumber in a very small way. She\u2019s nothing to give\nherself airs about.\u2019\nShe had by now unfolded the parchment. Picking up a\npen she dipped it in the inkstand and wrote her signature,\nKatherine Dorothy Greenshaw.\n\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 she said. \u2018You\u2019ve seen me sign it, and then\nyou two sign it, and that makes it legal.\u2019\nShe handed the pen to Raymond West. He hesitated a\nmoment, feeling an unexpected repulsion to what he was\nasked to do. Then he quickly scrawled the well-known\nsignature, for which his morning\u2019s mail usually brought at\nleast six demands a day.\nHorace took the pen from him and added his own minute\nsignature.\n\u2018That\u2019s done,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw.\nShe moved across to the bookcase and stood looking at\nthem uncertainly, then she opened a glass door, took out a\nbook and slipped the folded parchment inside.\n\u2018I\u2019ve my own places for keeping things,\u2019 she said.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Lady \nAudley\u2019s \nSecret,\u2019 \nRaymond \nWest \nremarked,\ncatching sight of the title as she replaced the book.\nMiss Greenshaw gave another cackle of laughter.\n\u2018Best-seller in its day,\u2019 she remarked. \u2018Not like your\nbooks, eh?\u2019\nShe gave Raymond a sudden friendly nudge in the ribs.\nRaymond was rather surprised that she even knew he wrote\nbooks. Although Raymond West was quite a name in\nliterature, he could hardly be described as a best-seller.\nThough softening a little with the advent of middle-age, his\nbooks dealt bleakly with the sordid side of life.\n\u2018I wonder,\u2019 Horace demanded breathlessly, \u2018if I might just\ntake a photograph of the clock?\u2019\n\u2018By all means,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw. \u2018It came, I believe,\nfrom the Paris exhibition.\u2019\n\u2018Very probably,\u2019 said Horace. He took his picture.\n\u2018This room\u2019s not been used much since my grandfather\u2019s\ntime,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw. \u2018This desk\u2019s full of old diaries of\nhis. Interesting, I should think. I haven\u2019t the eyesight to read\nthem myself. I\u2019d like to get them published, but I suppose\none would have to work on them a good deal.\u2019\n\u2018You could engage someone to do that,\u2019 said Raymond\nWest.\n\u2018Could I really? It\u2019s an idea, you know. I\u2019ll think about it.\u2019\nRaymond West glanced at his watch.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018We mustn\u2019t trespass on your kindness any longer,\u2019 he\nsaid.\n\u2018Pleased to have seen you,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw\ngraciously. \u2018Thought you were the policeman when I heard\nyou coming round the corner of the house.\u2019\n\u2018Why a policeman?\u2019 demanded Horace, who never\nminded asking questions.\nMiss Greenshaw responded unexpectedly.\n\u2018If you want to know the time, ask a policeman,\u2019 she\ncarolled, and with this example of Victorian wit, nudged\nHorace in the ribs and roared with laughter.\n\u2018It\u2019s been a wonderful afternoon,\u2019 sighed Horace as they\nwalked home. \u2018Really, that place has everything. The only\nthing the library needs is a body. Those old-fashioned\ndetective stories about murder in the library\u2014that\u2019s just the\nkind of library I\u2019m sure the authors had in mind.\u2019\n\u2018If you want to discuss murder,\u2019 said Raymond, \u2018you must\ntalk to my Aunt Jane.\u2019\n\u2018Your Aunt Jane? Do you mean Miss Marple?\u2019 He felt a\nlittle at a loss.\nThe charming old-world lady to whom he had been\nintroduced the night before seemed the last person to be\nmentioned in connection with murder.\n\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said Raymond. \u2018Murder is a speciality of hers.\u2019\n\u2018But my dear, how intriguing. What do you really mean?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I mean just that,\u2019 said Raymond. He paraphrased: \u2018Some\ncommit murder, some get mixed up in murders, others have\nmurder thrust upon them. My Aunt Jane comes into the third\ncategory.\u2019\n\u2018You are joking.\u2019\n\u2018Not in the least. I can refer you to the former\nCommissioner of Scotland Yard, several Chief Constables\nand one or two hard-working inspectors of the CID.\u2019\nHorace said happily that wonders would never cease.\nOver the tea table they gave Joan West, Raymond\u2019s wife,\nLou Oxley her niece, and old Miss Marple, ar\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the\nafternoon\u2019s happenings, recounting in detail everything that\nMiss Greenshaw had said to them.\n\u2018But I do think,\u2019 said Horace, \u2018that there is something a\nlittle sinister about the whole set-up. That duchess-like\ncreature, the housekeeper\u2014arsenic, perhaps, in the teapot,\nnow that she knows her mistress has made the will in her\nfavour?\u2019\n\u2018Tell us, Aunt Jane,\u2019 said Raymond. \u2018Will there be murder\nor won\u2019t there? What do you think?\u2019\n\u2018I think,\u2019 said Miss Marple, winding up her wool with a\nrather severe air, \u2018that you shouldn\u2019t joke about these\nthings as much as you do, Raymond. Arsenic is, of course,\nquite a possibility. So easy to obtain. Probably present in the\ntoolshed already in the form of weed killer.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, really, darling,\u2019 said Joan West, a\ufb00ectionately.\n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t that be rather too obvious?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s all very well to make a will,\u2019 said Raymond, \u2018I don\u2019t\nsuppose really the poor old thing has anything to leave\n\n----Page Break----\nexcept that awful white elephant of a house, and who would\nwant that?\u2019\n\u2018A \ufb01lm company possibly,\u2019 said Horace, \u2018or a hotel or an\ninstitution?\u2019\n\u2018They\u2019d expect to buy it for a song,\u2019 said Raymond, but\nMiss Marple was shaking her head.\n\u2018You know, dear Raymond, I cannot agree with you there.\nAbout the money, I mean. The grandfather was evidently\none of those lavish spenders who make money easily, but\ncan\u2019t keep it. He may have gone broke, as you say, but\nhardly bankrupt or else his son would not have had the\nhouse. Now the son, as is so often the case, was an entirely\ndi\ufb00erent character to his father. A miser. A man who saved\nevery penny. I should say that in the course of his lifetime\nhe probably put by a very good sum. This Miss Greenshaw\nappears to have taken after him, to dislike spending money,\nthat is. Yes, I should think it quite likely that she had quite a\ngood sum tucked away.\u2019\n\u2018In that case,\u2019 said Joan West, \u2018I wonder now\u2014what about\nLou?\u2019\nThey looked at Lou as she sat, silent, by the \ufb01re.\nLou was Joan West\u2019s niece. Her marriage had recently, as\nshe herself put it, come unstuck, leaving her with two young\nchildren and a bare su\ufb03ciency of money to keep them on.\n\u2018I mean,\u2019 said Joan, \u2018if this Miss Greenshaw really wants\nsomeone to go through diaries and get a book ready for\npublication\u2026\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s an idea,\u2019 said Raymond.\n\n----Page Break----\nLou said in a low voice:\n\u2018It\u2019s work I could do\u2014and I\u2019d enjoy it.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll write to her,\u2019 said Raymond.\n\u2018I wonder,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully, \u2018what the old\nlady meant by that remark about a policeman?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, it was just a joke.\u2019\n\u2018It reminded me,\u2019 said Miss Marple, nodding her head\nvigorously, \u2018yes, it reminded me very much of Mr Naysmith.\u2019\n\u2018Who was Mr Naysmith?\u2019 asked Raymond, curiously.\n\u2018He kept bees,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018and was very good at\ndoing the acrostics in the Sunday papers. And he liked\ngiving people false impressions just for fun. But sometimes\nit led to trouble.\u2019\nEverybody was silent for a moment, considering Mr\nNaysmith, but as there did not seem to be any points of\nresemblance between him and Miss Greenshaw, they\ndecided that dear Aunt Jane was perhaps getting a little bit\ndisconnected in her old age.\nII\nHorace Bindler went back to London without having\ncollected any more monstrosities and Raymond West wrote\na letter to Miss Greenshaw telling her that he knew of a Mrs\nLouisa Oxley who would be competent to undertake work on\nthe diaries. After a lapse of some days, a letter arrived,\nwritten in spidery old-fashioned handwriting, in which Miss\nGreenshaw declared herself anxious to avail herself of the\n\n----Page Break----\nservices of Mrs Oxley, and making an appointment for Mrs\nOxley to come and see her.\nLou duly kept the appointment, generous terms were\narranged and she started work on the following day.\n\u2018I\u2019m awfully grateful to you,\u2019 she said to Raymond. \u2018It will\n\ufb01t in beautifully. I can take the children to school, go on to\nGreenshaw\u2019s Folly and pick them up on my way back. How\nfantastic the whole set-up is! That old woman has to be\nseen to be believed.\u2019\nOn the evening of her \ufb01rst day at work she returned and\ndescribed her day.\n\u2018I\u2019ve hardly seen the housekeeper,\u2019 she said. \u2018She came\nin with co\ufb00ee and biscuits at half past eleven with her\nmouth pursed up very prunes and prisms, and would hardly\nspeak to me. I think she disapproves deeply of my having\nbeen engaged.\u2019 She went on, \u2018It seems there\u2019s quite a feud\nbetween her and the gardener, Alfred. He\u2019s a local boy and\nfairly lazy, I should imagine, and he and the housekeeper\nwon\u2019t speak to each other. Miss Greenshaw said in her\nrather grand way, \u201cThere have always been feuds as far as I\ncan remember between the garden and the house sta\ufb00. It\nwas so in my grandfather\u2019s time. There were three men and\na boy in the garden then, and eight maids in the house, but\nthere was always friction.\u201d \u2019\nOn the following day Lou returned with another piece of\nnews.\n\u2018Just fancy,\u2019 she said, \u2018I was asked to ring up the nephew\nthis morning.\u2019\n\u2018Miss Greenshaw\u2019s nephew?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Yes. It seems he\u2019s an actor playing in the company that\u2019s\ndoing a summer season at Boreham on Sea. I rang up the\ntheatre and left a message asking him to lunch tomorrow.\nRather fun, really. The old girl didn\u2019t want the housekeeper\nto know. I think Mrs Cresswell has done something that\u2019s\nannoyed her.\u2019\n\u2018Tomorrow another instalment of this thrilling serial,\u2019\nmurmured Raymond.\n\u2018It\u2019s exactly like a serial, isn\u2019t it? Reconciliation with the\nnephew, blood is thicker than water\u2014another will to be\nmade and the old will destroyed.\u2019\n\u2018Aunt Jane, you\u2019re looking very serious.\u2019\n\u2018Was I, my dear? Have you heard any more about the\npoliceman?\u2019\nLou looked bewildered. \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about a\npoliceman.\u2019\n\u2018That remark of hers, my dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018must\nhave meant something.\u2019\nLou arrived at her work the next day in a cheerful mood.\nShe passed through the open front door\u2014the doors and\nwindows of the house were always open. Miss Greenshaw\nappeared to have no fear of burglars, and was probably\njusti\ufb01ed, as most things in the house weighed several tons\nand were of no marketable value.\nLou had passed Alfred in the drive. When she \ufb01rst caught\nsight of him he had been leaning against a tree smoking a\ncigarette, but as soon as he had caught sight of her he had\nseized a broom and begun diligently to sweep leaves. An\nidle young man, she thought, but good looking. His features\n\n----Page Break----\nreminded her of someone. As she passed through the hall\non her way upstairs to the library she glanced at the large\npicture of Nathaniel Greenshaw which presided over the\nmantelpiece, showing him in the acme of Victorian\nprosperity, leaning back in a large arm-chair, his hands\nresting on the gold albert across his capacious stomach. As\nher glance swept up from the stomach to the face with its\nheavy jowls, its bushy eyebrows and its \ufb02ourishing black\nmoustache, the thought occurred to her that Nathaniel\nGreenshaw must have been handsome as a young man. He\nhad looked, perhaps, a little like Alfred\u2026\nShe went into the library, shut the door behind her,\nopened her typewriter and got out the diaries from the\ndrawer at the side of the desk. Through the open window\nshe caught a glimpse of Miss Greenshaw in a puce-coloured\nsprigged \nprint, \nbending \nover \nthe \nrockery, \nweeding\nassiduously. They had had two wet days, of which the weeds\nhad taken full advantage.\nLou, a town-bred girl, decided that if she ever had a\ngarden it would never contain a rockery which needed hand\nweeding. Then she settled down to her work.\nWhen Mrs Cresswell entered the library with the co\ufb00ee\ntray at half past eleven, she was clearly in a very bad\ntemper. She banged the tray down on the table, and\nobserved to the universe.\n\u2018Company for lunch\u2014and nothing in the house! What am\nI supposed to do, I should like to know? And no sign of\nAlfred.\u2019\n\u2018He was sweeping in the drive when I got here,\u2019 Lou\no\ufb00ered.\n\u2018I dare say. A nice soft job.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nMrs Cresswell swept out of the room and banged the\ndoor behind her. Lou grinned to herself. She wondered what\n\u2018the nephew\u2019 would be like.\nShe \ufb01nished her co\ufb00ee and settled down to her work\nagain. It was so absorbing that time passed quickly.\nNathaniel Greenshaw, when he started to keep a diary, had\nsuccumbed to the pleasure of frankness. Trying out a\npassage relating to the personal charm of a barmaid in the\nneighbouring town, Lou re\ufb02ected that a good deal of editing\nwould be necessary.\nAs she was thinking this, she was startled by a scream\nfrom the garden. Jumping up, she ran to the open window.\nMiss Greenshaw was staggering away from the rockery\ntowards the house. Her hands were clasped to her breast\nand between them there protruded a feathered shaft that\nLou recognized with stupefaction to be the shaft of an arrow.\nMiss Greenshaw\u2019s head, in its battered straw hat, fell\nforward on her breast. She called up to Lou in a failing voice:\n\u2018\u2026shot\u2026he shot me\u2026with an arrow\u2026get help\u2026\u2019\nLou rushed to the door. She turned the handle, but the\ndoor would not open. It took her a moment or two of futile\nendeavour to realize that she was locked in. She rushed\nback to the window.\n\u2018I\u2019m locked in.\u2019\nMiss Greenshaw, her back towards Lou, and swaying a\nlittle on her feet was calling up to the housekeeper at a\nwindow farther along.\n\u2018Ring police\u2026telephone\u2026\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThen, lurching from side to side like a drunkard she\ndisappeared from Lou\u2019s view through the window below into\nthe drawing-room. A moment later Lou heard a crash of\nbroken china, a heavy fall, and then silence. Her imagination\nreconstructed the scene. Miss Greenshaw must have\nstaggered blindly into a small table with a S\u00e8vres teaset on\nit.\nDesperately Lou pounded on the door, calling and\nshouting. There was no creeper or drain-pipe outside the\nwindow that could help her to get out that way.\nTired at last of beating on the door, she returned to the\nwindow. From the window of her sitting-room farther along,\nthe housekeeper\u2019s head appeared.\n\u2018Come and let me out, Mrs Oxley. I\u2019m locked in.\u2019\n\u2018So am I.\u2019\n\u2018Oh dear, isn\u2019t it awful? I\u2019ve telephoned the police.\nThere\u2019s an extension in this room, but what I can\u2019t\nunderstand, Mrs Oxley, is our being locked in. I never heard\na key turn, did you?\u2019\n\u2018No. I didn\u2019t hear anything at all. Oh dear, what shall we\ndo? Perhaps Alfred might hear us.\u2019 Lou shouted at the top of\nher voice, \u2018Alfred, Alfred.\u2019\n\u2018Gone to his dinner as likely as not. What time is it?\u2019\nLou glanced at her watch.\n\u2018Twenty-\ufb01ve past twelve.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s not supposed to go until half past, but he sneaks o\ufb00\nearlier whenever he can.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Do you think\u2014do you think\u2014\u2019\nLou meant to ask \u2018Do you think she\u2019s dead?\u2019 but the\nwords stuck in her throat.\nThere was nothing to do but wait. She sat down on the\nwindow-sill. It seemed an eternity before the stolid helmeted\n\ufb01gure of a police constable came round the corner of the\nhouse. She leant out of the window and he looked up at her,\nshading his eyes with his hand. When he spoke his voice\nheld reproof.\n\u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 he asked disapprovingly.\nFrom their respective windows, Lou and Mrs Cresswell\npoured a \ufb02ood of excited information down on him.\nThe constable produced a note-book and pencil. \u2018You\nladies ran upstairs and locked yourselves in? Can I have\nyour names, please?\u2019\n\u2018No. Somebody else locked us in. Come and let us out.\u2019\nThe constable said reprovingly, \u2018All in good time,\u2019 and\ndisappeared through the window below.\nOnce again time seemed in\ufb01nite. Lou heard the sound of\na car arriving, and, after what seemed an hour, but was\nactually three minutes, \ufb01rst Mrs Cresswell and then Lou,\nwere released by a police sergeant more alert than the\noriginal constable.\n\u2018Miss Greenshaw?\u2019 Lou\u2019s voice faltered. \u2018What\u2014what\u2019s\nhappened?\u2019\nThe sergeant cleared his throat.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you, madam,\u2019 he said, \u2018what I\u2019ve\nalready told Mrs Cresswell here. Miss Greenshaw is dead.\u2019\n\u2018Murdered,\u2019 said Mrs Cresswell. \u2018That\u2019s what it is\u2014\nmurder.\u2019\nThe sergeant said dubiously:\n\u2018Could have been an accident\u2014some country lads\nshooting with bows and arrows.\u2019\nAgain there was the sound of a car arriving. The sergeant\nsaid:\n\u2018That\u2019ll be the MO,\u2019 and started downstairs.\nBut it was not the MO. As Lou and Mrs Cresswell came\ndown the stairs a young man stepped hesitatingly through\nthe front door and paused, looking round him with a\nsomewhat bewildered air.\nThen, speaking in a pleasant voice that in some way\nseemed \nfamiliar \nto \nLou\u2014perhaps \nit \nhad \na \nfamily\nresemblance to Miss Greenshaw\u2019s\u2014he asked:\n\u2018Excuse me, does\u2014er\u2014does Miss Greenshaw live here?\u2019\n\u2018May I have your name if you please,\u2019 said the sergeant\nadvancing upon him.\n\u2018Fletcher,\u2019 said the young man. \u2018Nat Fletcher. I\u2019m Miss\nGreenshaw\u2019s nephew, as a matter of fact.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed, sir, well\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m sure\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Has anything happened?\u2019 asked Nat Fletcher.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018There\u2019s been an\u2014accident\u2014your aunt was shot with an\narrow\u2014penetrated the jugular vein\u2014\u2019\nMrs Cresswell spoke hysterically and without her usual\nre\ufb01nement:\n\u2018Your h\u2019aunt\u2019s been murdered, that\u2019s what\u2019s \u2019appened.\nYour h\u2019aunt\u2019s been murdered.\u2019\nIII\nInspector Welch drew his chair a little nearer to the table\nand let his gaze wander from one to the other of the four\npeople in the room. It was the evening of the same day. He\nhad called at the Wests\u2019 house to take Lou Oxley once more\nover her statement.\n\u2018You are sure of the exact words? Shot\u2014he shot me\u2014with\nan arrow\u2014get help?\u2019\nLou nodded.\n\u2018And the time?\u2019\n\u2018I looked at my watch a minute or two later\u2014it was then\ntwelve twenty-\ufb01ve.\u2019\n\u2018Your watch keeps good time?\u2019\n\u2018I looked at the clock as well.\u2019\nThe inspector turned to Raymond West.\n\u2018It appears, sir, that about a week ago you and a Mr\nHorace Bindler were witnesses to Miss Greenshaw\u2019s will?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nBrie\ufb02y, Raymond recounted the events of the afternoon\nvisit that he and Horace Bindler had paid to Greenshaw\u2019s\nFolly.\n\u2018This testimony of yours may be important,\u2019 said Welch.\n\u2018Miss Greenshaw distinctly told you, did she, that her will\nwas \nbeing \nmade \nin \nfavour \nof \nMrs \nCresswell, \nthe\nhousekeeper, that she was not paying Mrs Cresswell any\nwages in view of the expectations Mrs Cresswell had of\npro\ufb01ting by her death?\u2019\n\u2018That is what she told me\u2014yes.\u2019\n\u2018Would you say that Mrs Cresswell was de\ufb01nitely aware\nof these facts?\u2019\n\u2018I should say undoubtedly. Miss Greenshaw made a\nreference in my presence to bene\ufb01ciaries not being able to\nwitness a will and Mrs Cresswell clearly understood what\nshe meant by it. Moreover, Miss Greenshaw herself told me\nthat she had come to this arrangement with Mrs Cresswell.\u2019\n\u2018So Mrs Cresswell had reason to believe she was an\ninterested party. Motive\u2019s clear enough in her case, and I\ndare say she\u2019d be our chief suspect now if it wasn\u2019t for the\nfact that she was securely locked in her room like Mrs Oxley\nhere, and also that Miss Greenshaw de\ufb01nitely said a man\nshot her\u2014\u2019\n\u2018She de\ufb01nitely was locked in her room?\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes. Sergeant Cayley let her out. It\u2019s a big old-\nfashioned lock with a big old-fashioned key. The key was in\nthe lock and there\u2019s not a chance that it could have been\nturned from inside or any hanky-panky of that kind. No, you\ncan take it de\ufb01nitely that Mrs Cresswell was locked inside\nthat room and couldn\u2019t get out. And there were no bows and\n\n----Page Break----\narrows in the room and Miss Greenshaw couldn\u2019t in any case\nhave been shot from a window\u2014the angle forbids it\u2014no,\nMrs Cresswell\u2019s out of it.\u2019\nHe paused and went on:\n\u2018Would you say that Miss Greenshaw, in your opinion,\nwas a practical joker?\u2019\nMiss Marple looked up sharply from her corner.\n\u2018So the will wasn\u2019t in Mrs Cresswell\u2019s favour after all?\u2019 she\nsaid.\nInspector Welch looked over at her in a rather surprised\nfashion.\n\u2018That\u2019s a very clever guess of yours, madam,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018No. Mrs Cresswell isn\u2019t named as bene\ufb01ciary.\u2019\n\u2018Just like Mr Naysmith,\u2019 said Miss Marple, nodding her\nhead. \u2018Miss Greenshaw told Mrs Cresswell she was going to\nleave her everything and so got out of paying her wages;\nand then she left her money to somebody else. No doubt\nshe was vastly pleased with herself. No wonder she chortled\nwhen she put the will away in Lady Audley\u2019s Secret.\u2019\n\u2018It was lucky Mrs Oxley was able to tell us about the will\nand where it was put,\u2019 said the inspector. \u2018We might have\nhad a long hunt for it otherwise.\u2019\n\u2018A Victorian sense of humour,\u2019 murmured Raymond West.\n\u2018So she left her money to her nephew after all,\u2019 said Lou.\nThe inspector shook his head.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018she didn\u2019t leave it to Nat Fletcher. The\nstory goes around here\u2014of course I\u2019m new to the place and\nI only get the gossip that\u2019s second-hand\u2014but it seems that\nin the old days both Miss Greenshaw and her sister were set\non the handsome young riding master, and the sister got\nhim. No, she didn\u2019t leave the money to her nephew\u2014\u2019 He\npaused, rubbing his chin, \u2018She left it to Alfred,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Alfred\u2014the gardener?\u2019 Joan spoke in a surprised voice.\n\u2018Yes, Mrs West. Alfred Pollock.\u2019\n\u2018But why?\u2019 cried Lou.\nMiss Marple coughed and murmured:\n\u2018I should imagine, though perhaps I am wrong, that there\nmay have been\u2014what we might call family reasons.\u2019\n\u2018You could call them that in a way,\u2019 agreed the inspector.\n\u2018It\u2019s quite well known in the village, it seems, that Thomas\nPollock, Alfred\u2019s grandfather, was one of old Mr Greenshaw\u2019s\nby-blows.\u2019\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 cried Lou, \u2018the resemblance! I saw it this\nmorning.\u2019\nShe remembered how after passing Alfred she had come\ninto the house and looked up at old Greenshaw\u2019s portrait.\n\u2018I dare say,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018that she thought Alfred\nPollock might have a pride in the house, might even want to\nlive in it, whereas her nephew would almost certainly have\nno use for it whatever and would sell it as soon as he could\npossibly do so. He\u2019s an actor, isn\u2019t he? What play exactly is\nhe acting in at present?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nTrust an old lady to wander from the point, thought\nInspector Welch, but he replied civilly:\n\u2018I believe, madam, they are doing a season of James\nBarrie\u2019s plays.\u2019\n\u2018Barrie,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully.\n\u2018What Every Woman Knows,\u2019 said Inspector Welch, and\nthen blushed. \u2018Name of a play,\u2019 he said quickly. \u2018I\u2019m not\nmuch of a theatre-goer myself,\u2019 he added, \u2018but the wife\nwent along and saw it last week. Quite well done, she said it\nwas.\u2019\n\u2018Barrie wrote some very charming plays,\u2019 said Miss\nMarple, \u2018though I must say that when I went with an old\nfriend of mine, General Easterly, to see Barrie\u2019s Little Mary\n\u2014\u2019 she shook her head sadly, \u2018\u2014neither of us knew where to\nlook.\u2019\nThe inspector, unacquainted with the play Little Mary\nlooked completely fogged. Miss Marple explained:\n\u2018When I was a girl, Inspector, nobody ever mentioned the\nword stomach.\u2019\nThe inspector looked even more at sea. Miss Marple was\nmurmuring titles under her breath.\n\u2018The Admirable Crichton. Very clever. Mary Rose\u2014a\ncharming play. I cried, I remember. Quality Street I didn\u2019t\ncare for so much. Then there was A Kiss for Cinderella. Oh,\nof course.\u2019\nInspector Welch had no time to waste on theatrical\ndiscussion. He returned to the matter in hand.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018The question is,\u2019 he said, \u2018did Alfred Pollock know that\nthe old lady had made a will in his favour? Did she tell him?\u2019\nHe added: \u2018You see\u2014there\u2019s an archery club over at\nBoreham Lovell and Alfred Pollock\u2019s a member. He\u2019s a very\ngood shot indeed with a bow and arrow.\u2019\n\u2018Then isn\u2019t your case quite clear?\u2019 asked Raymond West.\n\u2018It would \ufb01t in with the doors being locked on the two\nwomen\u2014he\u2019d know just where they were in the house.\u2019\nThe inspector looked at him. He spoke with deep\nmelancholy.\n\u2018He\u2019s got an alibi,\u2019 said the inspector.\n\u2018I always think alibis are de\ufb01nitely suspicious.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe, sir,\u2019 said Inspector Welch. \u2018You\u2019re talking as a\nwriter.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t write detective stories,\u2019 said Raymond West,\nhorri\ufb01ed at the mere idea.\n\u2018Easy enough to say that alibis are suspicious,\u2019 went on\nInspector Welch, \u2018but unfortunately we\u2019ve got to deal with\nfacts.\u2019\nHe sighed.\n\u2018We\u2019ve got three good suspects,\u2019 he said. \u2018Three people\nwho, as it happened, were very close upon the scene at the\ntime. Yet the odd thing is that it looks as though none of the\nthree could have done it. The housekeeper I\u2019ve already\ndealt with\u2014the nephew, Nat Fletcher, at the moment Miss\nGreenshaw was shot, was a couple of miles away \ufb01lling up\nhis car at a garage and asking his way\u2014as for Alfred Pollock\nsix people will swear that he entered the Dog and Duck at\n\n----Page Break----\ntwenty past twelve and was there for an hour having his\nusual bread and cheese and beer.\u2019\n\u2018Deliberately establishing an alibi,\u2019 said Raymond West\nhopefully.\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Inspector Welch, \u2018but if so, he did establish\nit.\u2019\nThere was a long silence. Then Raymond turned his head\nto where Miss Marple sat upright and thoughtful.\n\u2018It\u2019s up to you, Aunt Jane,\u2019 he said. \u2018The inspector\u2019s\nba\ufb04ed, the sergeant\u2019s ba\ufb04ed, I\u2019m ba\ufb04ed, Joan\u2019s ba\ufb04ed,\nLou is ba\ufb04ed. But to you, Aunt Jane, it is crystal clear. Am I\nright?\u2019\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say that, dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018not crystal\nclear, and murder, dear Raymond, isn\u2019t a game. I don\u2019t\nsuppose poor Miss Greenshaw wanted to die, and it was a\nparticularly brutal murder. Very well planned and quite cold\nblooded. It\u2019s not a thing to make jokes about!\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Raymond, abashed. \u2018I\u2019m not really as\ncallous as I sound. One treats a thing lightly to take away\nfrom the\u2014well, the horror of it.\u2019\n\u2018That is, I believe, the modern tendency,\u2019 said Miss\nMarple, \u2018All these wars, and having to joke about funerals.\nYes, perhaps I was thoughtless when I said you were\ncallous.\u2019\n\u2018It isn\u2019t,\u2019 said Joan, \u2018as though we\u2019d known her at all well.\u2019\n\u2018That is very true,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018You, dear Joan, did\nnot know her at all. I did not know her at all. Raymond\n\n----Page Break----\ngathered an impression of her from one afternoon\u2019s\nconversation. Lou knew her for two days.\u2019\n\u2018Come now, Aunt Jane,\u2019 said Raymond, \u2018tell us your\nviews. You don\u2019t mind, Inspector?\u2019\n\u2018Not at all,\u2019 said the inspector politely.\n\u2018Well, my dear, it would seem that we have three people\nwho had, or might have thought they had, a motive to kill\nthe old lady. And three quite simple reasons why none of the\nthree could have done so. The housekeeper could not have\ndone so because she was locked in her room and because\nMiss Greenshaw de\ufb01nitely stated that a man shot her. The\ngardener could not have done it because he was inside the\nDog and Duck at the time the murder was committed, the\nnephew could not have done it because he was still some\ndistance away in his car at the time of the murder.\u2019\n\u2018Very clearly put, madam,\u2019 said the inspector.\n\u2018And since it seems most unlikely that any outsider\nshould have done it, where, then, are we?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what the inspector wants to know,\u2019 said Raymond\nWest.\n\u2018One so often looks at a thing the wrong way round,\u2019 said\nMiss Marple apologetically. \u2018If we can\u2019t alter the movements\nor the position of those three people, then couldn\u2019t we\nperhaps alter the time of the murder?\u2019\n\u2018You mean that both my watch and the clock were\nwrong?\u2019 asked Lou.\n\u2018No dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018I didn\u2019t mean that at all. I\nmean that the murder didn\u2019t occur when you thought it\n\n----Page Break----\noccurred.\u2019\n\u2018But I saw it,\u2019 cried Lou.\n\u2018Well, what I have been wondering, my dear, was\nwhether you weren\u2019t meant to see it. I\u2019ve been asking\nmyself, you know, whether that wasn\u2019t the real reason why\nyou were engaged for this job.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean, Aunt Jane?\u2019\n\u2018Well, dear, it seems odd. Miss Greenshaw did not like\nspending money, and yet she engaged you and agreed\nquite willingly to the terms you asked. It seems to me that\nperhaps you were meant to be there in that library on the\n\ufb01rst \ufb02oor, looking out of the window so that you could be\nthe key witness\u2014someone from outside of irreproachable\ngood faith\u2014to \ufb01x a de\ufb01nite time and place for the murder.\u2019\n\u2018But you can\u2019t mean,\u2019 said Lou, incredulously, \u2018that Miss\nGreenshaw intended to be murdered.\u2019\n\u2018What I mean, dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018is that you didn\u2019t\nreally know Miss Greenshaw. There\u2019s no real reason, is\nthere, why the Miss Greenshaw you saw when you went up\nto the house should be the same Miss Greenshaw that\nRaymond saw a few days earlier? Oh, yes, I know,\u2019 she went\non, to prevent Lou\u2019s reply, \u2018she was wearing the peculiar\nold-fashioned print dress and the strange straw hat, and had\nunkempt hair. She corresponded exactly to the description\nRaymond gave us last week-end. But those two women, you\nknow, were much of an age and height and size. The\nhousekeeper, I mean, and Miss Greenshaw.\u2019\n\u2018But the housekeeper is fat!\u2019 Lou exclaimed. \u2018She\u2019s got an\nenormous bosom.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nMiss Marple coughed.\n\u2018But my dear, surely, nowadays I have seen\u2014er\u2014them\nmyself in shops most indelicately displayed. It is very easy\nfor anyone to have a\u2014a bust\u2014of any size and dimension.\u2019\n\u2018What are you trying to say?\u2019 demanded Raymond.\n\u2018I was just thinking, dear, that during the two or three\ndays Lou was working there, one woman could have played\nthe two parts. You said yourself, Lou, that you hardly saw\nthe housekeeper, except for the one moment in the morning\nwhen she brought you in the tray with co\ufb00ee. One sees\nthose clever artists on the stage coming in as di\ufb00erent\ncharacters with only a minute or two to spare, and I am sure\nthe change could have been e\ufb00ected quite easily. That\nmarquise head-dress could be just a wig slipped on and o\ufb00.\u2019\n\u2018Aunt Jane! Do you mean that Miss Greenshaw was dead\nbefore I started work there?\u2019\n\u2018Not dead. Kept under drugs, I should say. A very easy job\nfor an unscrupulous woman like the housekeeper to do.\nThen she made the arrangements with you and got you to\ntelephone to the nephew to ask him to lunch at a de\ufb01nite\ntime. The only person who would have known that this Miss\nGreenshaw was not Miss Greenshaw would have been\nAlfred. And if you remember, the \ufb01rst two days you were\nworking there it was wet, and Miss Greenshaw stayed in the\nhouse. Alfred never came into the house because of his feud\nwith the housekeeper. And on the last morning Alfred was in\nthe drive, while Miss Greenshaw was working on the rockery\n\u2014I\u2019d like to have a look at that rockery.\u2019\n\u2018Do you mean it was Mrs Cresswell who killed Miss\nGreenshaw?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I think that after bringing you your co\ufb00ee, the woman\nlocked the door on you as she went out, carried the\nunconscious Miss Greenshaw down to the drawing-room,\nthen assumed her \u201cMiss Greenshaw\u201d disguise and went out\nto work on the rockery where you could see her from the\nwindow. In due course she screamed and came staggering\nto the house clutching an arrow as though it had penetrated\nher throat. She called for help and was careful to say \u201che\nshot me\u201d so as to remove suspicion from the housekeeper.\nShe also called up to the housekeeper\u2019s window as though\nshe saw her there. Then, once inside the drawing-room, she\nthrew over a table with porcelain on it\u2014and ran quickly\nupstairs, put on her marquise wig and was able a few\nmoments later to lean her head out of the window and tell\nyou that she, too, was locked in.\u2019\n\u2018But she was locked in,\u2019 said Lou.\n\u2018I know. That is where the policeman comes in.\u2019\n\u2018What policeman?\u2019\n\u2018Exactly\u2014what policeman? I wonder, Inspector, if you\nwould mind telling me how and when you arrived on the\nscene?\u2019\nThe inspector looked a little puzzled.\n\u2018At twelve twenty-nine we received a telephone call from\nMrs Cresswell, housekeeper to Miss Greenshaw, stating that\nher mistress had been shot. Sergeant Cayley and myself\nwent out there at once in a car and arrived at the house at\ntwelve thirty-\ufb01ve. We found Miss Greenshaw dead and the\ntwo ladies locked in their rooms.\u2019\n\u2018So, you see, my dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple to Lou. \u2018The\npolice constable you saw wasn\u2019t a real police constable. You\n\n----Page Break----\nnever thought of him again\u2014one doesn\u2019t\u2014one just accepts\none more uniform as part of the law.\u2019\n\u2018But who\u2014why?\u2019\n\u2018As to who\u2014well, if they are playing A Kiss for Cinderella,\na policeman is the principal character. Nat Fletcher would\nonly have to help himself to the costume he wears on the\nstage. He\u2019d ask his way at a garage being careful to call\nattention to the time\u2014twelve twenty-\ufb01ve, then drive on\nquickly, leave his car round a corner, slip on his police\nuniform and do his \u201cact\u201d.\u2019\n\u2018But why?\u2014why?\u2019\n\u2018Someone had to lock the housekeeper\u2019s door on the\noutside, and someone had to drive the arrow through Miss\nGreenshaw\u2019s throat. You can stab anyone with an arrow just\nas well as by shooting it\u2014but it needs force.\u2019\n\u2018You mean they were both in it?\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes, I think so. Mother and son as likely as not.\u2019\n\u2018But Miss Greenshaw\u2019s sister died long ago.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, but I\u2019ve no doubt Mr Fletcher married again. He\nsounds the sort of man who would, and I think it possible\nthat the child died too, and that this so-called nephew was\nthe second wife\u2019s child, and not really a relation at all. The\nwoman got a post as housekeeper and spied out the land.\nThen he wrote as her nephew and proposed to call upon her\n\u2014he may have made some joking reference to coming in his\npoliceman\u2019s uniform\u2014or asked her over to see the play. But\nI think she suspected the truth and refused to see him. He\nwould have been her heir if she had died without making a\nwill\u2014but of course once she had made a will in the\n\n----Page Break----\nhousekeeper\u2019s favour (as they thought) then it was clear\nsailing.\u2019\n\u2018But why use an arrow?\u2019 objected Joan. \u2018So very far\nfetched.\u2019\n\u2018Not far fetched at all, dear. Alfred belonged to an\narchery club\u2014Alfred was meant to take the blame. The fact\nthat he was in the pub as early as twelve twenty was most\nunfortunate from their point of view. He always left a little\nbefore his proper time and that would have been just right\n\u2014\u2019 she shook her head. \u2018It really seems all wrong\u2014morally, I\nmean, that Alfred\u2019s laziness should have saved his life.\u2019\nThe inspector cleared his throat.\n\u2018Well, madam, these suggestions of yours are very\ninteresting. I shall have, of course, to investigate\u2014\u2019\nIV\nMiss Marple and Raymond West stood by the rockery and\nlooked down at that gardening basket full of dying\nvegetation.\nMiss Marple murmured:\n\u2018Alyssum, saxifrage, cytisus, thimble campanula\u2026Yes,\nthat\u2019s all the proof I need. Whoever was weeding here\nyesterday morning was no gardener\u2014she pulled up plants\nas well as weeds. So now I know I\u2019m right. Thank you, dear\nRaymond, for bringing me here. I wanted to see the place\nfor myself.\u2019\nShe and Raymond both looked up at the outrageous pile\nof Greenshaw\u2019s Folly.\n\n----Page Break----\nA cough made them turn. A handsome young man was\nalso looking at the house.\n\u2018Plaguey big place,\u2019 he said. \u2018Too big for nowadays\u2014or so\nthey say. I dunno about that. If I won a football pool and\nmade a lot of money, that\u2019s the kind of house I\u2019d like to\nbuild.\u2019\nHe smiled bashfully at them.\n\u2018Reckon I can say so now\u2014that there house was built by\nmy great-grandfather,\u2019 said Alfred Pollock. \u2018And a \ufb01ne house\nit is, for all they call it Greenshaw\u2019s Folly!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nE-Book Extras\nThe Marples\nEssay by Charles Osborne\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Marples\n\u00a0\nThe Murder at the Vicarage; The Thirteen Problems; The\nBody in the Library; The Moving Finger; A Murder Is\nAnnounced; They Do It with Mirrors; A Pocket Full of Rye;\n4.50 from Paddington; The Mirror Crack\u2019d from Side to Side;\nA Caribbean Mystery; At Bertram\u2019s Hotel; Nemesis; Sleeping\nMurder; Miss Marple\u2019s Final Cases\n1. The Murder at the Vicarage (1930)\nThe murder of Colonel Protheroe\u2014shot through the head\u2014is\na shock to everyone in St. Mary Mead, though hardly an\nunpleasant one. Now even the vicar, who had declared that\nkilling the detested Protheroe would be \u2018doing the world at\nlarge a favour,\u2019 is a suspect\u2014the Colonel has been\ndispatched in the clergyman\u2019s study, no less. But tiny St.\nMary Mead is overpopulated with suspects. There is of\ncourse the faithless Mrs Protheroe; and there is of course\nher young lover\u2014an artist, to boot. Perhaps more surprising\nthan the revelation of the murderer is the detective who will\ncrack the case: \u2018a whitehaired old lady with a gentle,\nappealing manner.\u2019 Miss Jane Marple has arrived on the\nscene, and crime literature\u2019s private men\u2019s club of great\ndetectives will never be the same.\nSaturday Review of Literature: \u2018When she really hits her\nstride, as she does here, Agatha Christie is hard to\n\n----Page Break----\nsurpass.\u2019\n2. The Thirteen Problems (1932)\nOver six Tuesday evenings a group gathers at Miss Marple\u2019s\nhouse to ponder unsolved crimes. The company is inclined\nto forget their elderly hostess as they become mesmerized\nby the sinister tales they tell one another. But it is always\nMiss Marple\u2019s quiet genius that names the criminal or the\nmeans of the misdeed.

The murder seems without rhyme or\n\n----Page Break----\nreason\u2014until shrewd Jane Marple recalls that delightful\nnursery rhyme, \u2018Sing a Song of Sixpence.\u2019 A playful hint\nindeed for a murder that is anything but child\u2019s play.\nTimes Literary Supplement: \u2018Ingenious.\u2019\nThe New York Times: \u2018The best of the novels starring\nMiss Marple.\u2019\n8. 4.50 from Paddington (1957)\nFor an instant the two trains ran side by side. In that frozen\nmoment, Elspeth McGillicuddy stared helplessly out of her\ncarriage window as a man tightened his grip around a\nwoman\u2019s throat. The body crumpled. Then the other train\ndrew away. But who, apart from Mrs McGillicuddy\u2019s friend\nJane Marple, would take her story seriously? After all, there\nare no other witnesses, no suspects, and no case\u2014for there\nis no corpse, and no one is missing. Miss Marple asks her\nhighly \ne\ufb03cient \nand \nintelligent \nyoung \nfriend \nLucy\nEyelesbarrow to in\ufb01ltrate the Crackenthorpe family, who\nseem to be at the heart of the mystery, and help unmask a\nmurderer.\nOf note: The introduction of Lucy Eyelesbarrow as a side-\nkick to Miss Marple was lauded by the critics, but her work\nwith the older detective was limited to this novel.\n9. The Mirror Crack\u2019d from Side to Side (1962)\nThe quaint village of St. Mary Mead has been glamourized\nby the presence of screen queen Marina Gregg, who has\ntaken up residence in preparation for her comeback.

True, the warmth eased her\nrheumatism, but here in paradise nothing ever happened.\nThen a question was put to her by a stranger: \u2018Would you\nlike to see a picture of a murderer?\u2019 Before she has a chance\nto answer, the man vanishes, only to be found dead the\nnext day. The mysteries abound: Where is the picture? Why\nis the hotelier prone to nightmares? Why doesn\u2019t the most\ntalked-about guest, a reclusive millionaire, ever leave his\nroom? And why is Miss Marple herself fearful for her life?\nOf note: A Caribbean Mystery introduces the wealthy (and\ndi\ufb03cult) Mr Jason Ra\ufb01el, who will call upon Miss Marple for\nhelp in Nemesis (1971)\u2014after his death.\nObserver: \n\u2018Liveliness\u2026infectious \nzest\u2026as \ngood \nas\nanything Mrs Christie has done.\u2019\nThe New York Times: \u2018Throws o\ufb00 the false clues and\nmisleading events as only a master of the art can do.\u2019\n11. At Bertram\u2019s Hotel (1965)\nWhen Jane Marple comes up from the country for a holiday\nin London, she \ufb01nds what she\u2019s looking for at Bertram\u2019s: a\nrestored London hotel with traditional decor, impeccable\nservice\u2014and an unmistakable atmosphere of danger behind\nthe highly polished veneer.

The only problem is, Mr Ra\ufb01el has failed to name a\nsuspect or suspects. And, whoever they are, they will\ncertainly be determined to thwart Miss Marple\u2019s inquiries\u2014\nno matter what it will take to stop her.\nOf note: Nemesis is the last Jane Marple mystery that\nAgatha \nChristie \nwrote\u2014though \nnot \nthe \nlast \nMarple\n\n----Page Break----\npublished.\nBest Sellers: \u2018The old charm is still there and a good\ndeal of the old magic in plotting, too.\u2019\nTimes Literary Supplement: \u2018Miss Marple is an old lady\nnow, knowing that a scent for evil is still, in the evening\nof her days, her peculiar gift.\u2019\n13. Sleeping Murder (1976)\nSoon after Gwenda Reed moves into her new home, odd\nthings start to happen. Despite her best e\ufb00orts to\nmodernise the house, she only succeeds in dredging up its\npast. Worse, she feels an irrational sense of terror every\ntime she climbs the stairs\u2026In fear, Gwenda turns to Jane\nMarple to exorcise her ghosts. Between them, they are to\nsolve a \u2018perfect\u2019 crime committed many years before\u2026\nOf note: Agatha Christie wrote Sleeping Murder during World\nWar II and had it placed in a bank vault for over thirty years.\nChicago Tribune: \u2018Agatha Christie saved the best for\nlast.\u2019\nSunday Express: \u2018A puzzle that is tortuous, surprising,\nand\u2026satisfying.\u2019\n14. Miss Marple\u2019s Final Cases (1979)\nDespite the title, the stories collected here recount cases\nfrom the middle of Miss. Marple\u2019s career. They are:\n\u2018Sanctuary\u2019; \u2018Strange Jest\u2019; \u2018Tape-Measure Murder\u2019; \u2018The\nCase of the Caretaker\u2019; \u2018The Case of the Perfect Maid\u2019; \u2018Miss\nMarple Tells a Story\u2019; \u2018The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll\u2019; \u2018In a Glass\nDarkly\u2019; \u2018Greenshaw\u2019s Folly.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Republican (Spring\ufb01eld, Massachusetts): \u2018When it all\nbecomes clear as day, the reader can only say, \u201cNow\nwhy didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d But he never does. Mrs\nChristie at her best.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nCharles Osborne on Miss Marple\u2019s Final Cases\nMiss Marple Short Stories (1979)\nMiss Marple\u2019s Final Cases and two other stories was\npublished in the UK only, for the stories were already\navailable in other volumes published in the USA. Two of the\nstories, \u2018The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll\u2019 and \u2018Sanctuary\u2019, are to be\nfound in Double Sin (1961: see p. 301); four stories,\n\u2018Strange Jest\u2019, \u2018Tape Measure Murder\u2019, \u2018The Case of the\nPerfect Maid\u2019 and \u2018The Case of the Caretaker\u2019, are from\nThree Blind Mice (1950: see p. 237); and the remaining two\nstories, \u2018Miss Marple Tells a Story\u2019 and \u2018In a Glass Darkly\u2019,\ncome from The Regatta Mystery (1939: see p. 175).\nOf the eight stories, two (\u2018The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll\u2019 and \u2018In\na Glass Darkly\u2019) are not Miss Marple adventures. The\nremaining six ought not really to have been called Miss\nMarple\u2019s Final Cases, for they are examples of that\nredoubtable lady in mid-career. The publisher\u2019s justi\ufb01cation\nfor putting together a collection of them was that, although\nthey had appeared in magazines in the past, the stories\nwere being published in volume form for the \ufb01rst time in\nGreat Britain. A statement to this e\ufb00ect appeared in the\n\u2018blurb\u2019 on the inside of the front jacket. It is, however,\nslightly inaccurate, for \u2018Tape-Measure Murder\u2019 had found its\nway into Thirteen for Luck, \u2018a selection of mystery stories for\nyoung readers\u2019 which Collins had published in 1966.\n\n----Page Break----\nProblem at Pollensa Bay\nAbout Charles Osborne\nThis essay was adapted from Charles Osborne\u2019s The Life and\nCrimes of Agatha Christie: A Biographical Companion to the\nWorks of Agatha Christie (1982, rev. 1999). Mr. Osborne was\nborn in Brisbane in 1927. He is known internationally as an\nauthority on opera, and has written a number of books on\nmusical and literary subjects, among them The Complete\nOperas of Verdi (1969); Wagner and His World (1977); and\nW.H. Auden: The Life of a Poet (1980). An addict of crime\n\ufb01ction and the world\u2019s leading authority on Agatha Christie,\nCharles Osborne adapted the Christie plays Black Co\ufb00ee\n(Poirot); Spider\u2019s Web; and The Unexpected Guest into\nnovels. He lives in London.\n\n----Page Break----\nAbout Agatha Christie\nAgatha Christie is known throughout the world as the Queen\nof Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in\nEnglish and another billion in 100 foreign languages. She is\nthe most widely published author of all time and in any\nlanguage, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare. Mrs\nChristie is the author of eighty crime novels and short story\ncollections, nineteen plays, and six novels written under the\nname of Mary Westmacott.\nAgatha Christie\u2019s \ufb01rst novel, The Mysterious A\ufb00air at\nStyles, was written towards the end of World War I (during\nwhich she served in the Voluntary Aid Detachments). In it\nshe created Hercule Poirot, the little Belgian investigator\nwho was destined to become the most popular detective in\ncrime \ufb01ction since Sherlock Holmes. After having been\nrejected by a number of houses, The Mysterious A\ufb00air at\nStyles was eventually published by The Bodley Head in\n1920.\nIn 1926, now averaging a book a year, Agatha Christie\nwrote her masterpiece. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was\nthe \ufb01rst of her books to be published by William Collins and\nmarked the beginning of an author-publisher relationship\nthat lasted for \ufb01fty years and produced over seventy books.\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd was also the \ufb01rst of Agatha\nChristie\u2019s works to be dramatised\u2014as Alibi\u2014and to have a\nsuccessful run in London\u2019s West End. The Mousetrap, her\n\n----Page Break----\nmost famous play, opened in 1952 and runs to this day at St\nMartin\u2019s Theatre in the West End; it is the longest-running\nplay in history.\nAgatha Christie was made a Dame in 1971. She died in\n1976, since when a number of her books have been\npublished: the bestselling novel Sleeping Murder appeared\nin 1976, followed by An Autobiography and the short story\ncollections Miss Marple\u2019s Final Cases; Problem at Pollensa\nBay; and While the Light Lasts. In 1998, Black Co\ufb00ee was\nthe \ufb01rst of her plays to be novelised by Charles Osborne,\nMrs Christie\u2019s biographer.\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Agatha Christie Collection\nChristie Crime Classics\nThe Man in the Brown Suit\nThe Secret of Chimneys\nThe Seven Dials Mystery\nThe Mysterious Mr Quin\nThe Sittaford Mystery\nThe Hound of Death\nThe Listerdale Mystery\nWhy Didn\u2019t They Ask Evans?\nParker Pyne Investigates\nMurder Is Easy\nAnd Then There Were None\nTowards Zero\nDeath Comes as the End\nSparkling Cyanide\nCrooked House\nThey Came to Baghdad\nDestination Unknown\nSpider\u2019s Web *\nThe Unexpected Guest *\nOrdeal by Innocence\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Pale Horse\nEndless Night\nPassenger To Frankfurt\nProblem at Pollensa Bay\nWhile the Light Lasts\nHercule Poirot Investigates\nThe Mysterious A\ufb00air at Styles\nThe Murder on the Links\nPoirot Investigates\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd\nThe Big Four\nThe Mystery of the Blue Train\nBlack Co\ufb00ee *\nPeril at End House\nLord Edgware Dies\nMurder on the Orient Express\nThree-Act Tragedy\nDeath in the Clouds\nThe ABC Murders\nMurder in Mesopotamia\nCards on the Table\nMurder in the Mews\nDumb Witness\nDeath on the Nile\nAppointment with Death\n\n----Page Break----\nHercule Poirot\u2019s Christmas\nSad Cypress\nOne, Two, Buckle My Shoe\nEvil Under the Sun\nFive Little Pigs\nThe Hollow\nThe Labours of Hercules\nTaken at the Flood\nMrs McGinty\u2019s Dead\nAfter the Funeral\nHickory Dickory Dock\nDead Man\u2019s Folly\nCat Among the Pigeons\nThe Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\nThe Clocks\nThird Girl\nHallowe\u2019en Party\nElephants Can Remember\nPoirot\u2019s Early Cases\nCurtain: Poirot\u2019s Last Case\nMiss Marple Mysteries\nThe Murder at the Vicarage\nThe Thirteen Problems\nThe Body in the Library\nThe Moving Finger\n\n----Page Break----\nA Murder Is Announced\nThey Do It with Mirrors\nA Pocket Full of Rye\n4.50 from Paddington\nThe Mirror Crack\u2019d from Side to Side\nA Caribbean Mystery\nAt Bertram\u2019s Hotel\nNemesis\nSleeping Murder\nMiss Marple\u2019s Final Cases\nTommy & Tuppence\nThe Secret Adversary\nPartners in Crime\nNor M?\nBy the Pricking of My Thumbs\nPostern of Fate\nPublished as Mary Westmacott\nGiant\u2019s Bread\nUn\ufb01nished Portrait\nAbsent in the Spring\nThe Rose and the Yew Tree\nA Daughter\u2019s a Daughter\nThe Burden\nMemoirs\n\n----Page Break----\nAn Autobiography\nCome, Tell Me How You Live\nPlay Collections\nThe Mousetrap and Selected Plays\nWitness for the Prosecution and Selected Plays\n* novelised by Charles Osborne\n\n----Page Break----\nwww.agathachristie.com\nFor more information about Agatha Christie, please visit the\no\ufb03cial website.\n\n----Page Break----\nMISS MARPLE\u2019S FINAL CASES by Agatha Christie\nCopyright \u00a9 1979 Agatha Christie Limited (a Chorion company)\n\u201cEssay by Charles Osborne\u201d excerpted from The Life and Crimes of Agatha\nChristie.

            "Here's a summary of \"Miss Marple's Final Cases\" by Agatha Christie, formatted in a WhatsApp style and with detailed elaborations, exceeding 1000 words:\n\n*\ud83d\udcda *Miss Marple's Final Cases: A Detailed Summary* \ud83d\udcda*\n\nThis collection showcases nine intriguing short stories featuring the iconic Miss Jane Marple, Agatha Christie's beloved elderly sleuth.  While titled \"Final Cases,\" these stories actually represent Miss Marple's adventures from mid-career, offering a delightful glimpse into her astute mind and village wisdom. Alongside the stories, the document includes insightful essays about Miss Marple and Agatha Christie herself, enhancing the reader's appreciation of this timeless character and her creator.\n\n*\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f *Short Story Summaries:* \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f*\n\n*1\ufe0f\u20e3 *Sanctuary:*\n_Summary:_  Bunch Harmon, the vicar's wife, discovers a dying man in the church. His only word, whispered twice before passing away, is \"Sanctuary.\"  This mystery revolves around uncovering the man's identity and the reason he sought refuge in the church. The police initially believe it's a suicide, but Bunch, with her sharp intuition, suspects foul play and the meaning behind \"sanctuary\" becomes central to unraveling the truth.\n\n_Elaboration:_  The story kicks off with classic Christie village charm, personified by the endearing Bunch Harmon. The seemingly simple case of a suicide quickly becomes more complex as Bunch's observations and the dying man's enigmatic word \"sanctuary\" raise questions.  The limited clues, a wallet, a watch with initials W.S. and a return ticket, are typical Christie red herrings. The introduction of the supposed relatives, Mr. and Mrs. Eccles, and their suspicious behavior, further thickens the plot.  The story cleverly blends the peaceful setting of a village church with the grim reality of a murder mystery, setting the tone for Miss Marple's subtle yet incisive investigation, eventually revealing a past crime and hidden jewels.\n\n*2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Strange Jest:*\n_Summary:_  Young cousins Charmian Stroud and Edward Rossiter inherit \"practically nothing\" from their wealthy Great-Great-Uncle Mathew. However, a cryptic deathbed message involving winking and the word \"doves\" leads them to believe a hidden treasure exists at Ansteys, the family estate.  Desperate to save Ansteys from being sold, they enlist Miss Marple's help to decipher Uncle Mathew's strange jest and locate the hidden fortune.\n\n_Elaboration:_  \"Strange Jest\" embodies the classic treasure hunt trope with a delightful Christie twist.  The initial setup of the impoverished heirs and the eccentric uncle is instantly engaging. The clues are cleverly embedded in seemingly nonsensical ramblings and a bizarre recipe for baked ham. Miss Marple's method of deduction is showcased as she focuses on the uncle's personality and fondness for puns rather than complex codes. The story humorously satirizes the idea of buried gold bullion, revealing a much more ingenious and characteristically Christie solution involving rare stamps hidden within old letters, demonstrating that true treasure isn't always what it seems.\n\n*3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Tape-Measure Murder:*\n_Summary:_ Dressmaker Miss Politt arrives at Laburnum Cottage for a fitting with Mrs. Spenlow but finds no answer.  Miss Hartnell, a neighbor, investigates and discovers Mrs. Spenlow dead. Initially, suspicion falls on Mr. Spenlow, but Miss Marple, observing seemingly insignificant details like a dressmaker's pin near the body, suspects a more cunning killer: Miss Politt herself.\n\n_Elaboration:_  This story is a masterclass in observation and the importance of seemingly trivial details. Miss Marple's deduction hinges on a common dressmaking pin, an object easily overlooked by others. The story cleverly utilizes the setting of a quiet village and the mundane profession of a dressmaker to conceal a dark secret. The motive is rooted in a past jewel robbery, highlighting Christie's recurring theme of past crimes casting long shadows. The story showcases Miss Marple's ability to see beyond the obvious and connect seemingly disparate clues, ultimately revealing a motive based on greed and fear of exposure.\n\n*4\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Case of the Caretaker:*\n_Summary:_ Doctor Haydock presents Miss Marple with a manuscript detailing a recent tragedy: the death of Louise Laxton after being thrown from her horse, seemingly spooked by the caretaker's widow, Mrs. Murgatroyd, who had been cursing the Laxtons.  Miss Marple must unravel the truth behind the \"accident,\" considering the motives of various characters, including the husband, Harry Laxton, and his past relationship with another woman.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"The Case of the Caretaker\" is presented as a puzzle for Miss Marple to solve, mirroring the reader's own detective journey. The story delves into village gossip and suspicion, highlighting the themes of jealousy and greed. Mrs. Murgatroyd's dramatic cursing acts as a red herring, diverting attention from the true killer. Miss Marple's keen insight into human nature and her understanding of typical motivations lead her to the real culprit, exposing a carefully orchestrated murder plot motivated by money and a desire for a new love, concealed beneath a veneer of grief and coincidence.\n\n*5\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Case of the Perfect Maid:*\n_Summary:_  Rumors swirl around Gladys Holmes, a maid dismissed for suspected theft.  However, when a new maid, Mary Higgins, arrives and proves to be \"too good to be true,\" Miss Marple becomes suspicious.  A series of thefts at Old Hall, where Mary works, confirms Miss Marple's intuition, leading her to uncover a clever scheme involving impersonation and deception.\n\n_Elaboration:_  \"The Case of the Perfect Maid\" explores the theme of appearances being deceptive.  Mary Higgins, initially lauded as a paragon of domestic virtue, turns out to be a cunning thief. Miss Marple's suspicion is aroused by the maid's flawless persona and the exaggerated praise from her employers. The story cleverly uses the social context of domestic service and the expectations surrounding maids to create a believable disguise for the criminal. Miss Marple's observation of minor inconsistencies and her understanding of human fallibility enable her to pierce through the facade of perfection and expose the truth.\n\n*6\ufe0f\u20e3 *Miss Marple Tells a Story:*\n_Summary:_  Mr. Petherick, a solicitor, seeks Miss Marple's help in a baffling murder case. A woman, Mrs. Rhodes, is found stabbed in a hotel room, seemingly impossible for anyone to have entered or left unseen. Suspicion falls on her husband, but Miss Marple, through keen observation and understanding of human behavior, proposes an ingenious solution involving a clever disguise and misdirection.\n\n_Elaboration:_  \"Miss Marple Tells a Story\" is a classic locked-room mystery, showcasing Christie's brilliance in crafting intricate plots.  The seemingly impossible crime scene and the limited suspects create a compelling puzzle. Miss Marple's methodically analyzes the facts, focusing on the witness testimonies and the overlooked detail of the chambermaid's appearance. Her deduction hinges on the concept of misdirection and the power of assumption, revealing a murderer who cleverly exploited the mundane and the expected, using a disguise to commit the crime in plain sight.\n\n*7\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll:*\n_Summary:_  At a London dressmaking shop, a velvet doll mysteriously appears in the fitting room and begins to move around on its own, unsettling the staff.  The doll's presence becomes increasingly unnerving, creating an atmosphere of unease and fear until the doll is dramatically thrown out the window, only to be reclaimed by a child, suggesting a possible desire for love behind the uncanny events.\n\n_Elaboration:_  \"The Dressmaker's Doll\" is a departure from the typical murder mystery, leaning more towards the suspenseful and slightly supernatural. The story explores themes of fear, the uncanny, and the power of suggestion. The doll's unexplained movements create a growing sense of dread and paranoia among the characters. While not a traditional crime, the story builds suspense and explores the psychological impact of the unexplained. The ambiguous ending, with the child claiming the doll desires love, leaves the reader pondering the true nature of the doll's unsettling presence and whether it was truly malevolent or simply misunderstood.\n\n*8\ufe0f\u20e3 *In A Glass Darkly:*\n_Summary:_  A young man, while dressing for dinner, sees a terrifying vision in his mirror: a girl being strangled in a room behind him.  Later, he meets the girl from his vision and her fianc\u00e9, a man with a scar matching the one he saw in the mirror.  Years later, he recounts the story, reflecting on whether his vision was prophetic and how his actions, based on this vision, altered the course of lives.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"In A Glass Darkly\" delves into the realm of the premonition and the supernatural, a less common theme in Miss Marple stories, yet still explored through a rational lens. The story questions the nature of reality and perception, and the potential for psychic glimpses into the future. The protagonist's dilemma of whether to act on his vision and intervene in Sylvia's engagement creates suspense.  The story ultimately reveals a more grounded explanation, but the initial premise of the vision and its impact on the characters' lives adds a layer of psychological intrigue and questions of fate versus free will.\n\n*9\ufe0f\u20e3 *Greenshaw\u2019s Folly:*\n_Summary:_  Raymond West and his friend Horace Bindler visit Greenshaw's Folly, an eccentric mansion, where they meet Miss Greenshaw.  She asks them to witness her will, leaving her estate to her housekeeper, Mrs. Cresswell. Soon after, Miss Greenshaw is murdered with an arrow.

A man lies huddled and dying on the chancel steps of the cold, unheated church.  His feeble pulse and greenish pallor speak of imminent death.  Bunch, a practical and observant woman, quickly assesses the situation. The man, dressed in a shabby dark suit, clutches a wad of handkerchief to his chest, around which dark brown stains, clearly dried blood, are visible.  As Bunch kneels beside him, his eyes flutter open, fixating on her face with surprising clarity.  In a weak voice, he utters a single, impactful word: \"Sanctuary.\" He repeats it once more, a faint smile accompanying the plea, before his eyes close again, and his breath becomes shallow.  Bunch, realizing the gravity of the situation, leaves the church to seek help from Dr. Griffiths, setting in motion a chain of events that unveils a mystery far deeper than a simple suicide. The police, initially inclined to see it as self-inflicted, are soon confronted with the complexities of the man's identity, his last word, and the suspicious behavior of those who claim to be his family. Miss Marple, though not physically present, is instrumental in guiding Bunch's astute observations, leading to the uncovering of a jewel heist and a desperate man's final plea for refuge.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Sanctuary\" masterfully sets the stage with the contrast between the serenity of a village church and the intrusion of violence and death. Bunch Harmon, the vicar's wife, is immediately established as a key figure \u2013 not a detective herself, but possessing the sharp eyes and common sense that Miss Marple often relies on in others.  The story is rich in atmosphere, vividly portraying the damp November air and the chilly darkness of the unheated church.  The dying man's cryptic utterance, \"Sanctuary,\" becomes the central enigma, a word pregnant with meaning and historical weight.  The initial investigation by Sergeant Hayes focuses on the obvious: the man's pockets yield a wallet, a watch with initials \"W.S.\", and a return ticket to London, suggesting a possible suicide of a depressed individual.  However, Bunch's intuition, honed by village life and a keen understanding of human nature (traits mirroring Miss Marple's own), questions the simplicity of this explanation.  The arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Eccles, claiming to be the man's sister and brother-in-law, introduces a layer of suspicion. Their eagerness to claim the deceased's belongings, particularly his coat, and their relief when told he left no message beyond \"Sanctuary,\" raises red flags for Bunch.\n\nThe watch, engraved \"To Walter from his father,\" contradicts Mrs. Eccles's consistent use of \"William\" or \"Bill\" when referring to her supposed brother, Walter Sandbourne. This discrepancy, noticed by Bunch, becomes a crucial clue.  Bunch's visit to Miss Marple in London solidifies her suspicions. Miss Marple, despite her physical absence from the village, acts as the guiding intellect, prompting Bunch to articulate her doubts and directing her towards the crucial piece of evidence \u2013 the coat. Bunch's cleverness in discovering the hidden cloakroom ticket within the coat lining, a detail missed by the supposed relatives, is a testament to her own developing detective skills, fostered by her association with Miss Marple (even indirectly).  The cloakroom ticket leads to a suitcase at Paddington Station, containing not personal papers, as the Eccleses might have hoped, but theatrical costumes adorned with real emeralds.\n\nThe story then unravels the backstory of Walter St. John, an escaped convict who was once connected to a famous jewel robbery involving a dancer named Zobeida and her emerald necklace.  His dying word \"Sanctuary\" takes on a new layer of meaning - not just refuge from his pursuers (the Eccleses/Moss), but also a spiritual sanctuary sought in the church as he faced death.  The Eccleses, revealed to be jewel thieves themselves, were after the jewels they believed Sandbourne (actually St. John/Walter) had taken.  The twist is that the jewels weren't stolen, but were Zobeida's own, cleverly hidden within her costumes. Walter St. John, Zobeida's widower, was trying to secure them for their daughter, Jewel, whose guardians in Chipping Cleghorn were facing hardship. The \"please\" he uttered to Bunch before dying was a plea for help for his daughter.  \"Sanctuary\" culminates in a poignant resolution where the jewels, initially sought for greed, are ultimately used to secure the future of the innocent child, Jewel, fulfilling the dying man's last wish and bringing a different kind of sanctuary \u2013 safety and security \u2013 to his daughter. The story beautifully blends suspense, village charm, and a touch of pathos, showcasing Miss Marple's wisdom working through the observant Bunch Harmon.\n\n*2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Strange Jest: Unraveling the Riddle* \ud83e\udde9*\n\n_Summary:_ Charmian Stroud and Edward Rossiter, cousins and the sole heirs of their eccentric Great-Great-Uncle Mathew, are left bewildered and practically penniless after his death.  Uncle Mathew, known for his wealth and growing suspicion of banks and financial institutions, had often declared his intention to bury his fortune.  His will, however, reveals a startling lack of assets.  Charmian and Edward, deeply fond of Ansteys, the family estate they are poised to inherit, are devastated at the prospect of having to sell it.  They are further intrigued by Uncle Mathew's cryptic last words: \"You'll be all right, my pretty pair of doves,\" accompanied by a wink and a tap on his right eye.  Interpreting this as a clue to his hidden wealth, they embark on a frantic treasure hunt, tearing apart the house and grounds of Ansteys in a desperate search.  Exhausted and disheartened, they seek help from Jane Helier, a mutual friend, who introduces them to Miss Marple, holding her up as a solver of mysteries extraordinaire.  Initially skeptical, Charmian and Edward are soon captivated by Miss Marple's astute mind and her unconventional approach to deciphering their uncle's \"strange jest.\"\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Strange Jest\" is a lighthearted yet cleverly constructed mystery that plays on the classic trope of buried treasure.  The opening establishes the charming but financially precarious situation of Charmian and Edward, making the reader immediately sympathetic to their plight. Uncle Mathew is portrayed as a whimsical eccentric, adding a layer of playful intrigue to the mystery. His distrust of modern finance and his pronouncements about burying treasure are deliberately misleading, setting up the \"strange jest\" of the title.  The cousins' exhaustive and ultimately fruitless search of Ansteys highlights their desperation and lack of direction, emphasizing their need for Miss Marple's guidance.  Miss Marple, despite initial skepticism from the younger generation, quickly demonstrates her unique detective prowess.  She doesn't immediately jump to physical clues or complex codes, but instead focuses on understanding Uncle Mathew's character.  Her seemingly rambling anecdotes about her own Uncle Henry, initially appearing irrelevant and even irritating to Charmian and Edward, are, in fact, crucial to her deduction.\n\nMiss Marple's analysis of Uncle Mathew as a man fond of \"obvious jokes,\" puns, and teasing, shifts the focus from a literal treasure hunt to a more metaphorical and intellectual puzzle.  Her insight that Uncle Mathew's talk of buried gold was likely a \"blind\" is key to redirecting the investigation.  The discovery of the secret drawer in Uncle Mathew's desk, prompted by Miss Marple's suggestion, appears initially to be another dead end, containing only love letters and a recipe for baked ham.  However, Miss Marple's sharp eye and understanding of wordplay lead her to the crucial clue within the signature of the love letters: \"Betty Martin.\"  She connects this to the common expression \"All my eye and Betty Martin,\" meaning nonsense, revealing that the letters themselves are a diversion. The letters, seemingly old, are revealed to be fakes, written much later by Uncle Mathew himself.  Miss Marple then focuses on the postmark date on the envelopes, 1851, and recalls her stamp-collecting great-nephew's knowledge of rare stamps, particularly an 1851 blue two-cent stamp.  This leads to the brilliant realization that the \"treasure\" is not buried gold or jewels, but valuable postage stamps hidden within the seemingly worthless love letters. The \"strange jest\" is Uncle Mathew's playful way of revealing the location of his hidden wealth, relying on his relatives' intelligence and wit to decipher his riddle.  The story concludes with the cousins' delighted discovery of the stamps and their newfound financial security, allowing them to save Ansteys and embark on their married life, all thanks to Miss Marple's unconventional but ultimately effective detective methods, proving that the greatest treasures are not always buried, but sometimes hidden in plain sight, veiled by a \"strange jest.\"\n\n*3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Tape-Measure Murder: The Devil in the Details* \ud83d\udcd0*\n\n_Summary:_ In the quaint village of St. Mary Mead, Miss Politt, the local dressmaker, arrives at Laburnum Cottage for a fitting appointment with Mrs. Spenlow.  Finding no answer, she seeks the help of Miss Hartnell, a boisterous and assertive neighbor.  Miss Hartnell's loud knocking and peering through the window lead to a horrifying discovery: Mrs. Spenlow lies lifeless on the hearthrug.  The initial investigation focuses on Mr. Spenlow, the husband, whose seemingly detached demeanor and financial gain upon his wife's death make him the prime suspect in the eyes of the local police, particularly Inspector Slack.  However, Miss Marple, observing from her home next door, takes a different view.  A seemingly insignificant detail \u2013 a dressmaker's pin near Mrs. Spenlow's body \u2013 catches her attention, leading her to suspect Miss Politt, the dressmaker herself, and to unravel a crime rooted in a decades-old jewel robbery.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Tape-Measure Murder\" is a meticulously crafted story that exemplifies Christie's skill in building suspense through subtle clues and misdirection. The story opens with the mundane routine of a dressmaker's fitting, quickly disrupted by the shocking discovery of Mrs. Spenlow's murder.  The village setting of St. Mary Mead, usually associated with tranquility, is once again disturbed by violent crime, highlighting the contrast Christie often employs.  The initial suspicion directed towards Mr. Spenlow is a classic red herring, fueled by his unemotional reaction and the financial motive.  Inspector Slack, a characteristically confident but somewhat unimaginative policeman, readily accepts the husband as the prime suspect, overlooking more subtle clues.  Miss Marple, in contrast, with her keen eye for detail and her understanding of human nature, focuses on the seemingly insignificant pin.  This pin, a common dressmaker's tool, becomes the linchpin of her deduction, pointing directly to Miss Politt.\n\nMiss Marple's investigation is subtle and observational.  She engages Constable Palk, the local village policeman, in conversation, ostensibly about pins in general, but subtly guiding him to recall the pin he found at the crime scene.  Her visit to Miss Politt's residence, under the guise of altering an old dress, is a clever pretext to gather further information and observe the dressmaker's demeanor.  The story cleverly weaves in the backstory of Mrs. Spenlow's past as a between-maid at Sir Robert Abercrombie's place, where a valuable emerald necklace was stolen years ago. This past crime becomes crucial to understanding the motive.  Miss Marple's deduction hinges on the realization that Mrs. Spenlow was wearing a kimono, not a dress, suggesting she was preparing for a fitting. This detail, combined with the dressmaker's pin, leads Miss Marple to the conclusion that Miss Politt strangled Mrs. Spenlow with her own tape measure during the fitting, a crime of opportunity born from a long-held secret and fear of exposure.\n\nThe motive is revealed to be rooted in the old jewel robbery.  Mrs. Spenlow, the former tweeny-maid, and Miss Politt, the former lady's maid at Abercrombie's, were accomplices in the theft. Mrs. Spenlow had prospered, while Miss Politt remained in a humbler position, possibly harboring resentment.  The arrival of Ted Gerard, a young man associated with a religious group, and his influence on Mrs. Spenlow's conscience, becomes the catalyst for murder.  Miss Marple deduces that Mrs. Spenlow, under Gerard's influence, was likely considering confessing to her past crime, a prospect that terrified Miss Politt, leading her to commit murder to silence her former accomplice and protect her own freedom.  The story concludes with Miss Politt's arrest, her motive and method exposed by Miss Marple's astute observation of a seemingly trivial detail \u2013 a dressmaker's pin \u2013 proving that in crime, as in dressmaking, the smallest details can hold the key to the perfect fit, or in this case, the perfect murder.\n\n*4\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Case of the Caretaker: Unmasking Deception* \ud83c\udfad*\n\n_Summary:_ Dr. Haydock, concerned for Miss Marple's post-flu depression, presents her with a manuscript \u2013 a real-life puzzle he has written, hoping it will stimulate her mind.  The manuscript details the tragic death of Louise Laxton, who was thrown from her horse, seemingly frightened by the curses of old Mrs. Murgatroyd, the former caretaker of Kingsdean House.  While the incident is initially deemed an accident, Miss Marple, through Dr. Haydock's manuscript, begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding Louise's death, focusing on the motives and behaviors of various characters, particularly the bereaved husband, Harry Laxton, and his complex relationships with others in the village.  The story unfolds through Miss Marple's analytical mind as she pieces together clues from the manuscript, uncovering a web of deceit and revealing a calculated murder plot masked as a tragic accident.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"The Case of the Caretaker\" is unique in its presentation as a manuscript puzzle, directly involving Miss Marple as the reader and detective.  Dr. Haydock's manuscript acts as a narrative device, presenting the facts of the case and allowing Miss Marple (and the reader) to engage in armchair detection. The story is set in the context of village life, with its close-knit community, gossip, and underlying tensions.  The characters are vividly drawn: Harry Laxton, the charming but potentially unscrupulous husband; Louise, the wealthy and somewhat naive bride haunted by superstition; Clarice Vane, the doctor's niece and Louise's new friend; Bella Edge, Harry's former flame; and the menacing Mrs. Murgatroyd, the seemingly crazed caretaker's widow.  The narrative initially focuses on Mrs. Murgatroyd's strange behavior, her curses and threats, making her appear as the obvious catalyst, if not directly responsible, for Louise's death.  This sets up a classic red herring, drawing attention away from the true killer.\n\nMiss Marple's deduction begins with questioning the caretaker's motive.  Mrs. Murgatroyd's behavior seems exaggerated and theatrical, inconsistent with genuine grief or resentment.  This leads Miss Marple to suspect bribery and a staged performance.  She considers the relationships between the characters, particularly Harry Laxton's past affair with Bella Edge and his current marriage to the wealthy Louise.  The motive of greed and the possibility of Harry wanting to inherit Louise's fortune and reunite with Bella become apparent.  The introduction of Clarice Vane as a close friend to both Harry and Louise adds another layer of complexity.  Miss Marple, through the manuscript's details, observes Harry's calculated actions, his seemingly genuine grief, and his attempts to deflect suspicion onto Mrs. Murgatroyd.  The key to solving the puzzle is a seemingly insignificant detail \u2013 the hypodermic syringe found in Harry's pocket by Dr. Haydock after Louise's death. This detail, absent from the initial manuscript presented to Miss Marple but revealed later by Dr. Haydock, becomes the crucial piece of evidence.\n\nMiss Marple connects the syringe to the drug strophanthin and deduces that Harry murdered Louise, not through the horse accident, but by administering a fatal dose of the drug, ensuring her death was attributed to her injuries.  The horse accident, witnessed by the bakers, and Mrs. Murgatroyd's cursing were carefully staged elements of Harry's elaborate plan to create a seemingly accidental death and divert suspicion.  Bella Edge's confession to obtaining the strophanthin for Harry and Mrs. Murgatroyd's admission of being bribed to play her cursing role confirm Miss Marple's deductions.  The story concludes with the exposure of Harry's calculated and cold-blooded murder plot, motivated by greed and a desire to marry Clarice, revealing the dark undercurrents beneath the surface of village life and the manipulative nature of a charming but ruthless killer, all revealed through Miss Marple's astute reading of Dr. Haydock's manuscript and her insightful understanding of human motivation and deception.\n\n*5\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Case of the Perfect Maid: Cracks in Perfection* \ud83e\ude9e*\n\n_Summary:_ Edna, Miss Marple's maid, seeks her mistress's help for her cousin, Gladys, who was dismissed from her position with the Misses Skinner due to a missing brooch incident.  While Miss Marple initially dismisses it, she becomes intrigued when the Skinners hire a new maid, Mary Higgins, who is lauded as \"perfect.\"  Mary's exceptional skills and flawless demeanor strike Miss Marple as suspicious.  Soon after Mary's arrival, a series of jewel thefts plague the residents of Old Hall, where the Skinners reside.  Miss Marple, sensing a connection, begins to investigate, suspecting that the \"perfect maid\" may be far from what she seems, and that Gladys's dismissal might be more sinister than it appears.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"The Case of the Perfect Maid\" explores the deceptive nature of appearances and the dangers of judging by surface impressions.  The story begins with the seemingly mundane issue of a dismissed maid and a missing brooch, typical village gossip fodder.  Gladys Holmes, despite her \"bouncing, self-opinionated\" nature, is established as intrinsically honest, making her dismissal seem unjust.  The introduction of Mary Higgins, the \"perfect maid,\" immediately raises suspicion for Miss Marple.  Her perfection, her flawless references, and her ability to effortlessly manage the demanding Miss Emily Skinner, are all red flags for the astute elderly sleuth.  Miss Marple's suspicion is rooted in her understanding that true perfection is often unattainable and that appearances can be deliberately misleading, especially when they seem too good to be true.\n\nThe series of thefts at Old Hall, targeting various residents, including the Skinners themselves, confirms Miss Marple's intuition.  The thefts are carried out with professional precision, suggesting an inside job.  Miss Marple's investigation is subtle and observational.  She visits Old Hall, ostensibly to recruit stall-holders for the vicarage fete, but primarily to observe Mary Higgins firsthand.  She notes Mary's impeccable demeanor, her almost too-perfect efficiency, and her ability to anticipate every need.  A seemingly accidental encounter where Miss Marple drops her bag, scattering its contents, provides a crucial opportunity.  Mary's handling of the items, particularly a sticky piece of rock candy and a mirror, allows Miss Marple to cleverly obtain Mary's fingerprints, a key piece of evidence.  Miss Marple's insight that \"paragons\" are rare and often deceptive drives her investigation.  She realizes that Mary Higgins is not who she claims to be and that her perfection is a carefully constructed facade.\n\nThe story culminates in the revelation that Mary Higgins is a fraud, a professional thief who used the guise of a perfect maid to gain access to Old Hall and its residents' valuables.  Miss Marple's cleverness in obtaining fingerprints and her astute deduction that Miss Emily Skinner, the hypochondriac sister, and Mary Higgins were never seen together, lead her to the shocking truth.  Miss Emily and Mary Higgins are the same person, a cunning thief who impersonated a frail invalid and a perfect maid to orchestrate the robberies.  Miss Lavinia, blinded by her desire for a perfect servant and her belief in her sister's illness, is completely deceived.  The story highlights the dangers of superficial judgments and the importance of looking beyond appearances to uncover the truth, proving that even in the most tranquil village settings, deception and criminality can lurk beneath a veneer of perfection.  Gladys Holmes is exonerated, her honesty vindicated by Miss Marple's keen observation and unwavering pursuit of the truth, restoring her reputation and highlighting the injustice of snap judgments based on appearances.\n\n*6\ufe0f\u20e3 *Miss Marple Tells a Story: The Illusion of Impossibility* \ud83d\udeaa*\n\n_Summary:_  Solicitor Mr. Petherick seeks Miss Marple's unique perspective on a perplexing murder case that has baffled even Scotland Yard.  The victim, Mrs. Rhodes, was found stabbed to death in her locked hotel room.  Her husband, Mr. Rhodes, is the prime suspect, but insists on his innocence.  The room was seemingly impenetrable, with the only other door locked from the inside and the window latched. Witnesses confirm that no one entered or left the room during the crucial timeframe, except for a chambermaid.  Miss Marple, intrigued by the seemingly impossible nature of the crime, listens intently to Mr. Petherick's account, focusing on the details of the hotel layout and the testimonies of the witnesses, searching for the flaw in the seemingly airtight scenario.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Miss Marple Tells a Story\" is a classic locked-room mystery, a subgenre Agatha Christie excels in.  The story immediately presents an intriguing puzzle: a murder committed in a room seemingly impossible to enter or leave undetected.  The limited suspects and the seemingly airtight alibis create a compelling challenge for Miss Marple (and the reader). Mr. Rhodes, initially presented as the most likely culprit, is portrayed as somewhat hapless and bewildered, making his guilt less certain.  The focus shifts to the seemingly impossible logistics of the crime. The hotel setting, with its corridors, connecting rooms, and various witnesses, becomes a crucial element in the puzzle.  Miss Marple's method of deduction is characteristically methodical and insightful.  She doesn't rely on complex forensic analysis or elaborate theories, but instead focuses on the human element, questioning the witnesses' perceptions and assumptions.\n\nMiss Marple's key insight lies in questioning the description of the chambermaid.  She asks Mr. Petherick and Mr. Rhodes to describe the chambermaid, revealing their vague and indistinct recollections. This leads her to the crucial realization that the witnesses likely focused on the \"chambermaid's uniform\" rather than the individual woman wearing it.  She proposes the ingenious solution that the murderer disguised themselves as a chambermaid, exploiting the fact that witnesses would subconsciously register the uniform and not necessarily the person underneath it.  This disguise allowed the murderer to enter and leave Mrs. Rhodes's room in plain sight, unnoticed as an intruder.  The locked-room aspect is explained by the murderer entering through Mr. Rhodes's connecting room, committing the murder, locking the door from Mrs. Rhodes's room to the hallway from the inside, and then exiting back through Mr. Rhodes's room, all while disguised as the seemingly innocuous chambermaid.\n\nThe motive is revealed to be revenge. Miss Carruthers, using a false name and disguise, was driven by insanity stemming from the accidental death of her child, caused by Mrs. Rhodes's reckless driving.  Her elaborate plan, meticulously executed, was motivated by a desire for vengeance, cleverly exploiting the mundane and the expected to commit an almost \"invisible\" murder.  Miss Marple's deduction, based on keen observation and understanding of human perception and misdirection, solves the seemingly impossible crime, highlighting her brilliance in seeing beyond the obvious and uncovering the truth hidden in plain sight, proving that even the most impenetrable locks can be circumvented by human ingenuity and deception.\n\n*7\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll:  Uncanny Presence* \ud83e\ude9e*\n\n_Summary:_ In a chic London dressmaking salon, a life-sized velvet doll mysteriously appears in the fitting room.  Initially unnoticed, the doll gradually begins to unsettle the staff and owner, Miss Coombe, as it seems to move around the room on its own \u2013 sitting at the desk, appearing on the window sill, changing positions on the sofa.  The doll's uncanny presence creates an atmosphere of unease and fear, disrupting the shop's routine and impacting the women's work.  The story follows the growing anxiety and bewilderment of Sybil Fox, Miss Coombe's assistant, and Mrs. Groves, the cleaner, as they grapple with the doll's inexplicable movements and its increasingly disturbing influence.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"The Dressmaker's Doll\" is a unique and atmospheric story, stepping away from the typical murder mystery to explore themes of the uncanny, fear of the unknown, and psychological unease.  The doll itself is the central mystery, its unexplained movements and silent presence creating a creeping sense of dread.  The setting of a dressmaking salon, usually associated with creativity and elegance, becomes imbued with a sense of the unsettling and the macabre.  The story focuses on the psychological impact of the doll on the characters, particularly Sybil and Miss Coombe.  Their initial bewilderment gradually transforms into fear and a feeling of being haunted or possessed by the doll's presence.  The doll's movements are subtle and gradual, adding to the sense of unease.  It is never explicitly stated that the doll is moving on its own, leaving room for interpretation, suggesting the possibility of psychological projection or a shared delusion among the women.\n\nThe reactions of the characters are crucial to the story's atmosphere. Mrs. Groves, the cleaner, is the first to express outright fear, articulating the doll's \"creepy\" and \"unnatural\" presence.  Sybil, initially more rational, becomes increasingly disturbed and preoccupied by the doll, her rational explanations failing to dispel the growing sense of unease.  Miss Coombe, the owner, initially amused, eventually succumbs to the unsettling atmosphere, becoming increasingly forgetful and anxious.  The story explores the power of suggestion and the way fear can amplify seemingly insignificant events.  The doll becomes a focal point for their anxieties, its silent presence acting as a catalyst for their growing unease and paranoia.  The attempt to dispose of the doll by throwing it out the window is a moment of dramatic action, but ultimately futile.  The doll's return, in the arms of a small child who claims to love it, offers a somewhat ambiguous resolution.  The child's words, \"She wants to be loved,\" suggest a possible interpretation of the doll's movements not as malevolent, but as a desperate plea for attention or affection, transforming the creepy and malicious presence into something more poignant and perhaps even tragic. The story ends on an unresolved note, leaving the reader to ponder the true nature of the doll's presence and the psychological impact of the unexplained and the uncanny.  It is a story less about solving a crime and more about exploring the darker corners of the human psyche and the unsettling power of the inanimate to evoke profound fear and unease.\n\n*8\ufe0f\u20e3 *In A Glass Darkly: Visions of the Future?* \ud83d\udd2e*\n\n_Summary:_  The story is narrated in the first person by an unnamed man who recounts a chilling experience from his youth.  In the summer of 1914, while visiting his friend Neil Carslake at Badgeworthy, he has a disturbing vision reflected in his dressing-room mirror.  He sees a girl with golden hair being strangled by a man with a scar.  Later that evening, he meets Neil's sister, Sylvia, the spitting image of the girl in his vision, and her fianc\u00e9, Charles Crawley, who bears the distinctive scar.  Haunted by the premonition, the narrator grapples with whether to intervene, fearing he may seem foolish or disrupt Sylvia's happiness, yet driven by a sense of impending tragedy.  He eventually confides in Sylvia, setting in motion a chain of events that profoundly alters the course of their lives and raises questions about fate, free will, and the nature of prophetic visions.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"In A Glass Darkly\" is a deeply personal and introspective story, focusing on the narrator's inner turmoil and moral dilemma rather than a traditional whodunit.  The story explores themes of premonition, fate, jealousy, and self-destruction.  The opening vision in the mirror is vivid and chilling, establishing a sense of impending doom.  The narrator's immediate recognition of Sylvia and Charles in real life as the figures from his vision creates a powerful sense of unease and inevitability.  His internal conflict is central to the narrative. He is torn between his rational skepticism and the compelling force of his vision, between his desire to protect Sylvia and his fear of appearing ridiculous or interfering in her life.  His growing love for Sylvia further complicates his dilemma, adding a layer of personal stake and emotional intensity.\n\nThe narrator's confession to Sylvia and her surprising reaction \u2013 belief and gratitude \u2013 marks a turning point in the story.  Sylvia's strength and pragmatism contrast with the narrator's initial hesitation and fear.  The outbreak of World War I provides a historical backdrop, overshadowing personal concerns with the larger tragedy of global conflict.  The war also acts as a catalyst for change in the narrator's life, forcing him to confront his feelings for Sylvia and his own mortality.  The death of Charles Crawley in the war removes one obstacle, but the narrator's deep-seated jealousy becomes the primary antagonist in his and Sylvia's relationship.  His jealousy, fueled by insecurity and possessiveness, gradually erodes Sylvia's love and drives her away.  The climax of the story is a dramatic confrontation where the narrator, consumed by jealousy, almost reenacts his vision, attempting to strangle Sylvia.  The mirror image of himself strangling Sylvia, mirroring his initial vision, acts as a moment of self-recognition and a turning point.\n\nThis near-fatal act of violence ironically becomes a catalyst for healing and reconciliation.  It forces the narrator to confront his inner demons and allows Sylvia to understand the depth of his torment.  The story concludes with a somewhat ambiguous resolution.  While the narrator and Sylvia ultimately find happiness together, the question of whether the initial vision was a genuine premonition or a psychological projection remains unanswered.  The narrator reflects on the \"what ifs,\" pondering how different their lives might have been had he acted differently or interpreted his vision another way.  \"In A Glass Darkly\" is a powerful exploration of human psychology, the destructive nature of jealousy, and the enduring mystery of fate and free will, presented through the lens of a chilling and unforgettable vision in a mirror.\n\n*9\ufe0f\u20e3 *Greenshaw\u2019s Folly:  Family Secrets and Fatal Inheritance* \ud83c\udff0*\n\n_Summary:_ Raymond West, seeking entertainment for his literary critic guest Horace Bindler, takes him to Greenshaw's Folly, a bizarre and imposing mansion.  They meet the eccentric owner, Miss Katherine Greenshaw, who, in a surprising turn, asks them to witness her will, leaving her estate to her housekeeper, Mrs. Cresswell.  Soon after, Miss Greenshaw is murdered with an arrow in her garden.  The police investigation focuses on three suspects: Mrs. Cresswell, the housekeeper and apparent beneficiary; Nat Fletcher, Miss Greenshaw's nephew; and Alfred Pollock, the gardener.  However, each suspect has a seemingly solid alibi.  Miss Marple, through Raymond's account and subsequent investigation, unravels a complex web of family secrets, hidden identities, and a cleverly orchestrated murder plot driven by greed and inheritance.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Greenshaw's Folly\" is a classic country house mystery, steeped in family history and hidden motives, set against the backdrop of an extravagantly bizarre mansion.  Greenshaw's Folly itself becomes a character, its architectural monstrosity mirroring the tangled and distorted relationships within the Greenshaw family.  Miss Greenshaw is portrayed as an eccentric and somewhat miserly old woman, adding to the story's quirky charm.  The initial setup, with the witnessing of the will and the apparent beneficiary being the housekeeper, immediately establishes a potential motive for murder.  The murder itself, with an arrow, is dramatic and unusual, adding a layer of theatricality to the crime.  The three suspects \u2013 the housekeeper, the nephew, and the gardener \u2013 each with seemingly airtight alibis, create a classic \"impossible crime\" scenario.  Inspector Welch, the investigating officer, is initially baffled, highlighting the complexity of the puzzle.\n\nMiss Marple, relying on Raymond and Lou's accounts and her own keen observation, begins to piece together the truth.  Her deduction hinges on the idea of misdirection and the staging of events.  She questions the timing of the murder, suggesting that Lou was deliberately placed in the library to act as a witness to a fabricated timeline.  Miss Marple's \"village parallels\" come into play as she connects Miss Greenshaw's eccentricities to the behavior of Mr. Naysmith, a local character known for his practical jokes and misleading impressions.  This leads her to suspect that Miss Greenshaw's will and her pronouncements about leaving everything to Mrs. Cresswell were themselves a deception, a \"strange jest\" intended to mislead.  The realization that Miss Greenshaw was likely drugged and replaced by Mrs. Cresswell in disguise before the \"murder\" is key to unlocking the mystery.  The \"policeman\" who arrives at the scene is revealed to be Nat Fletcher in disguise, his \"alibi\" carefully constructed to divert suspicion.\n\nThe motive is revealed to be inheritance and family secrets.  Alfred Pollock, the gardener, is revealed to be the illegitimate great-grandson of Nathaniel Greenshaw, making him the true heir.  Mrs. Cresswell and Nat Fletcher, revealed to be mother and son and not related to the Greenshaws, conspired to murder Miss Greenshaw and frame Alfred, believing they could inherit the estate by eliminating both the apparent beneficiary (Mrs. Cresswell herself) and the most likely heir (Alfred).  The archery club membership and Alfred's skill with a bow and arrow were deliberately intended to frame him for the crime.  Miss Marple's visit to Greenshaw's Folly and her observation of the poorly weeded rockery confirms her theory, revealing that the \"Miss Greenshaw\" working in the garden was not the real Miss Greenshaw, but Mrs. Cresswell in disguise, lacking the true Miss Greenshaw's gardening knowledge.  The story concludes with the exposure of the mother-son murder plot, thwarted by Miss Marple's astute deductions, revealing the dark secrets hidden within the walls of Greenshaw's Folly and the lengths to which people will go for greed and inheritance, proving that even in the most bizarre and eccentric settings, human nature and its darker impulses remain constant.\n\nThis expanded document should provide you with a very detailed understanding of each story in \"Miss Marple's Final Cases.\" Let me know if you need further elaboration on any specific point!",

A good deal of rich\ngarden soil was attached to her strong brogue shoes and a\nfew fragments of earth were adhering to her nose, but of\nthat fact she was perfectly unconscious.\nShe had a slight struggle in opening the vicarage gate\nwhich hung, rustily, half o\ufb00 its hinges. A pu\ufb00 of wind caught\nat her battered felt hat, causing it to sit even more rakishly\nthan it had done before. \u2018Bother!\u2019 said Bunch.\nChristened by her optimistic parents Diana, Mrs Harmon\nhad become Bunch at an early age for somewhat obvious\nreasons and the name had stuck to her ever since.\nClutching the chrysanthemums, she made her way through\nthe gate to the churchyard, and so to the church door.\nThe November air was mild and damp. Clouds scudded\nacross the sky with patches of blue here and there. Inside,\nthe church was dark and cold; it was unheated except at\nservice times.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Brrrrrh!\u2019 said Bunch expressively. \u2018I\u2019d better get on with\nthis quickly. I don\u2019t want to die of cold.\u2019\nWith the quickness born of practice she collected the\nnecessary paraphernalia: vases, water, \ufb02ower-holders. \u2018I\nwish we had lilies,\u2019 thought Bunch to herself. \u2018I get so tired\nof these scraggy chrysanthemums.\u2019 Her nimble \ufb01ngers\narranged the blooms in their holders.\nThere was nothing particularly original or artistic about\nthe decorations, for Bunch Harmon herself was neither\noriginal nor artistic, but it was a homely and pleasant\narrangement. Carrying the vases carefully, Bunch stepped\nup the aisle and made her way towards the altar. As she did\nso the sun came out.\nIt shone through the east window of somewhat crude\ncoloured glass, mostly blue and red\u2014the gift of a wealthy\nVictorian churchgoer. The e\ufb00ect was almost startling in its\nsudden opulence. \u2018Like jewels,\u2019 thought Bunch. Suddenly\nshe stopped, staring ahead of her. On the chancel steps was\na huddled dark form.\nPutting down the \ufb02owers carefully, Bunch went up to it\nand bent over it. It was a man lying there, huddled over on\nhimself. Bunch knelt down by him and slowly, carefully, she\nturned him over. Her \ufb01ngers went to his pulse\u2014a pulse so\nfeeble and \ufb02uttering that it told its own story, as did the\nalmost greenish pallor of his face. There was no doubt,\nBunch thought, that the man was dying.\nHe was a man of about forty-\ufb01ve, dressed in a dark,\nshabby suit. She laid down the limp hand she had picked up\nand looked at his other hand. This seemed clenched like a\n\ufb01st on his breast. Looking more closely she saw that the\n\ufb01ngers were closed over what seemed to be a large wad or\n\n----Page Break----\nhandkerchief which he was holding tightly to his chest. All\nround the clenched hand there were splashes of a dry brown\n\ufb02uid which, Bunch guessed, was dry blood. Bunch sat back\non her heels, frowning.\nUp till now the man\u2019s eyes had been closed but at this\npoint they suddenly opened and \ufb01xed themselves on\nBunch\u2019s face. They were neither dazed nor wandering. They\nseemed fully alive and intelligent. His lips moved, and\nBunch bent forward to catch the words, or rather the word.\nIt was only one word that he said:\n\u2018Sanctuary.\u2019\nThere was, she thought, just a very faint smile as he\nbreathed out this word. There was no mistaking it, for after\na moment he said it again, \u2018Sanctuary\u2026\u2019\nThen, with a faint, long-drawn-out sigh, his eyes closed\nagain. Once more Bunch\u2019s \ufb01ngers went to his pulse. It was\nstill there, but fainter now and more intermittent. She got up\nwith decision.\n\u2018Don\u2019t move,\u2019 she said, \u2018or try to move. I\u2019m going for\nhelp.\u2019\nThe man\u2019s eyes opened again but he seemed now to be\n\ufb01xing his attention on the coloured light that came through\nthe east window. He murmured something that Bunch could\nnot quite catch. She thought, startled, that it might have\nbeen her husband\u2019s name.\n\u2018Julian?\u2019 she said. \u2018Did you come here to \ufb01nd Julian?\u2019 But\nthere was no answer. The man lay with eyes closed, his\nbreathing coming in slow, shallow fashion.\n\n----Page Break----\nBunch turned and left the church rapidly. She glanced at\nher watch and nodded with some satisfaction. Dr Gri\ufb03ths\nwould still be in his surgery. It was only a couple of minutes\u2019\nwalk from the church. She went in, without waiting to knock\nor ring, passing through the waiting room and into the\ndoctor\u2019s surgery.\n\u2018You must come at once,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018There\u2019s a man\ndying in the church.\u2019\nSome minutes later Dr Gri\ufb03ths rose from his knees after\na brief examination.\n\u2018Can we move him from here into the vicarage? I can\nattend to him better there\u2014not that it\u2019s any use.\u2019\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018I\u2019ll go along and get things\nready. I\u2019ll get Harper and Jones, shall I? To help you carry\nhim.\u2019\n\u2018Thanks. I can telephone from the vicarage for an\nambulance, but I\u2019m afraid\u2014by the time it comes\u2026\u2019 He left\nthe remark un\ufb01nished.\nBunch said, \u2018Internal bleeding?\u2019\nDr Gri\ufb03ths nodded. He said, \u2018How on earth did he come\nhere?\u2019\n\u2018I think he must have been here all night,\u2019 said Bunch,\nconsidering. \u2018Harper unlocks the church in the morning as\nhe goes to work, but he doesn\u2019t usually come in.\u2019\nIt was about \ufb01ve minutes later when Dr Gri\ufb03ths put\ndown the telephone receiver and came back into the\nmorning-room where the injured man was lying on quickly\n\n----Page Break----\narranged blankets on the sofa. Bunch was moving a basin of\nwater and clearing up after the doctor\u2019s examination.\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s that,\u2019 said Gri\ufb03ths. \u2018I\u2019ve sent for an\nambulance and I\u2019ve noti\ufb01ed the police.\u2019 He stood, frowning,\nlooking down on the patient who lay with closed eyes. His\nleft hand was plucking in a nervous, spasmodic way at his\nside.\n\u2018He was shot,\u2019 said Gri\ufb03ths. \u2018Shot at fairly close quarters.\nHe rolled his handkerchief up into a ball and plugged the\nwound with it so as to stop the bleeding.\u2019\n\u2018Could he have gone far after that happened?\u2019 Bunch\nasked.\n\u2018Oh, yes, it\u2019s quite possible. A mortally wounded man has\nbeen known to pick himself up and walk along a street as\nthough nothing had happened, and then suddenly collapse\n\ufb01ve or ten minutes later. So he needn\u2019t have been shot in\nthe church. Oh no. He may have been shot some distance\naway. Of course, he may have shot himself and then\ndropped the revolver and staggered blindly towards the\nchurch. I don\u2019t quite know why he made for the church and\nnot for the vicarage.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, I know that,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018He said it: \u201cSanctuary.\u201d \u2019\nThe doctor stared at her. \u2018Sanctuary?\u2019\n\u2018Here\u2019s Julian,\u2019 said Bunch, turning her head as she heard\nher husband\u2019s steps in the hall. \u2018Julian! Come here.\u2019\nThe Reverend Julian Harmon entered the room. His\nvague, scholarly manner always made him appear much\nolder than he really was. \u2018Dear me!\u2019 said Julian Harmon,\n\n----Page Break----\nstaring in a mild, puzzled manner at the surgical appliances\nand the prone \ufb01gure on the sofa.\nBunch explained with her usual economy of words. \u2018He\nwas in the church, dying. He\u2019d been shot. Do you know him,\nJulian? I thought he said your name.\u2019\nThe vicar came up to the sofa and looked down at the\ndying man. \u2018Poor fellow,\u2019 he said, and shook his head. \u2018No, I\ndon\u2019t know him. I\u2019m almost sure I\u2019ve never seen him\nbefore.\u2019\nAt that moment the dying man\u2019s eyes opened once\nmore. They went from the doctor to Julian Harmon and from\nhim to his wife. The eyes stayed there, staring into Bunch\u2019s\nface. Gri\ufb03ths stepped forward.\n\u2018If you could tell us,\u2019 he said urgently.\nBut with eyes \ufb01xed on Bunch, the man said in a weak\nvoice, \u2018Please\u2014please\u2014\u2019 And then, with a slight tremor, he\ndied\u2026\nSergeant Hayes licked his pencil and turned the page of\nhis notebook.\n\u2018So that\u2019s all you can tell me, Mrs Harmon?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s all,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018These are the things out of his\ncoat pockets.\u2019\nOn a table at Sergeant Hayes\u2019s elbow was a wallet, a\nrather battered old watch with the initials W.S. and the\nreturn half of a ticket to London. Nothing more.\n\u2018You\u2019ve found out who he is?\u2019 asked Bunch.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018A Mr and Mrs Eccles phoned up the station. He\u2019s her\nbrother, it seems. Name of Sandbourne. Been in a low state\nof health and nerves for some time. He\u2019s been getting worse\nlately. The day before yesterday he walked out and didn\u2019t\ncome back. He took a revolver with him.\u2019\n\u2018And he came out here and shot himself with it?\u2019 said\nBunch. \u2018Why?\u2019\n\u2018Well, you see, he\u2019d been depressed\u2026\u2019\nBunch interrupted him. \u2018I don\u2019t mean that. I mean, why\nhere?\u2019\nSince Sergeant Hayes obviously did not know the answer\nto that one, he replied in an oblique fashion, \u2018Come out\nhere, he did, on the \ufb01ve-ten bus.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bunch again. \u2018But why?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know, Mrs Harmon,\u2019 said Sergeant Hayes.\n\u2018There\u2019s no accounting. If the balance of the mind is\ndisturbed\u2014\u2019\nBunch \ufb01nished for him. \u2018They may do it anywhere. But it\nstill seems to me unnecessary to take a bus out to a small\ncountry place like this. He didn\u2019t know anyone here, did he?\u2019\n\u2018Not so far as can be ascertained,\u2019 said Sergeant Hayes.\nHe coughed in an apologetic manner and said, as he rose to\nhis feet, \u2018It may be as Mr and Mrs Eccles will come out and\nsee you, ma\u2019am\u2014if you don\u2019t mind, that is.\u2019\n\u2018Of course I don\u2019t mind,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018It\u2019s very natural. I\nonly wish I had something to tell them.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll be getting along,\u2019 said Sergeant Hayes.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m only so thankful,\u2019 said Bunch, going with him to the\nfront door, \u2018that it wasn\u2019t murder.\u2019\nA car had driven up at the vicarage gate. Sergeant\nHayes, glancing at it, remarked: \u2018Looks as though that\u2019s Mr\nand Mrs Eccles come here now, ma\u2019am, to talk with you.\u2019\nBunch braced herself to endure what, she felt, might be\nrather a di\ufb03cult ordeal. \u2018However,\u2019 she thought, \u2018I can\nalways call Julian to help me. A clergyman\u2019s a great help\nwhen people are bereaved.\u2019\nExactly what she had expected Mr and Mrs Eccles to be\nlike, Bunch could not have said, but she was conscious, as\nshe greeted them, of a feeling of surprise. Mr Eccles was a\nstout \ufb02orid man whose natural manner would have been\ncheerful and facetious. Mrs Eccles had a vaguely \ufb02ashy look\nabout her. She had a small, mean, pursed-up mouth. Her\nvoice was thin and reedy.\n\u2018It\u2019s been a terrible shock, Mrs Harmon, as you can\nimagine,\u2019 she said.\n\u2018Oh, I know,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018It must have been. Do sit\ndown. Can I o\ufb00er you\u2014well, perhaps it\u2019s a little early for tea\n\u2014\u2019\nMr Eccles waved a pudgy hand. \u2018No, no, nothing for us,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018It\u2019s very kind of you, I\u2019m sure. Just wanted to\u2026\nwell\u2026what poor William said and all that, you know?\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s been abroad a long time,\u2019 said Mrs Eccles, \u2018and I\nthink he must have had some very nasty experiences. Very\nquiet and depressed he\u2019s been, ever since he came home.\nSaid the world wasn\u2019t \ufb01t to live in and there was nothing to\nlook forward to. Poor Bill, he was always moody.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nBunch stared at them both for a moment or two without\nspeaking.\n\u2018Pinched my husband\u2019s revolver, he did,\u2019 went on Mrs\nEccles. \u2018Without our knowing. Then it seems he come here\nby bus. I suppose that was nice feeling on his part. He\nwouldn\u2019t have liked to do it in our house.\u2019\n\u2018Poor fellow, poor fellow,\u2019 said Mr Eccles, with a sigh. \u2018It\ndoesn\u2019t do to judge.\u2019\nThere was another short pause, and Mr Eccles said, \u2018Did\nhe leave a message? Any last words, nothing like that?\u2019\nHis bright, rather pig-like eyes watched Bunch closely.\nMrs Eccles, too, leaned forward as though anxious for the\nreply.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Bunch quietly. \u2018He came into the church when\nhe was dying, for sanctuary.\u2019\nMrs Eccles said in a puzzled voice. \u2018Sanctuary? I don\u2019t\nthink I quite\u2026\u2019\nMr Eccles interrupted. \u2018Holy place, my dear,\u2019 he said\nimpatiently. \u2018That\u2019s what the vicar\u2019s wife means. It\u2019s a sin\u2014\nsuicide, you know. I expect he wanted to make amends.\u2019\n\u2018He tried to say something just before he died,\u2019 said\nBunch. \u2018He began, \u201cPlease,\u201d but that\u2019s as far as he got.\u2019\nMrs Eccles put her handkerchief to her eyes and sni\ufb00ed.\n\u2018Oh, dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s terribly upsetting, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\u2018There, there, Pam,\u2019 said her husband. \u2018Don\u2019t take on.\nThese things can\u2019t be helped. Poor Willie. Still, he\u2019s at peace\nnow. Well, thank you very much, Mrs Harmon. I hope we\n\n----Page Break----\nhaven\u2019t interrupted you. A vicar\u2019s wife is a busy lady, we\nknow that.\u2019\nThey shook hands with her. Then Eccles turned back\nsuddenly to say, \u2018Oh yes, there\u2019s just one other thing. I think\nyou\u2019ve got his coat here, haven\u2019t you?\u2019\n\u2018His coat?\u2019 Bunch frowned.\nMrs Eccles said, \u2018We\u2019d like all his things, you know.\nSentimental-like.\u2019\n\u2018He had a watch and a wallet and a railway ticket in the\npockets,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018I gave them to Sergeant Hayes.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s all right, then,\u2019 said Mr Eccles. \u2018He\u2019ll hand them\nover to us, I expect. His private papers would be in the\nwallet.\u2019\n\u2018There was a pound note in the wallet,\u2019 said Bunch.\n\u2018Nothing else.\u2019\n\u2018No letters? Nothing like that?\u2019\nBunch shook her head.\n\u2018Well, thank you again, Mrs Harmon. The coat he was\nwearing\u2014perhaps the sergeant\u2019s got that too, has he?\u2019\nBunch frowned in an e\ufb00ort of remembrance.\n\u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018I don\u2019t think\u2026let me see. The doctor and I\ntook his coat o\ufb00 to examine his wound.\u2019 She looked round\nthe room vaguely. \u2018I must have taken it upstairs with the\ntowels and basin.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder now, Mrs Harmon, if you don\u2019t mind\u2026We\u2019d like\nhis coat, you know, the last thing he wore. Well, the wife\n\n----Page Break----\nfeels rather sentimental about it.\u2019\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Would you like me to have it\ncleaned \ufb01rst? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s rather\u2014well\u2014stained.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, no, no, that doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\nBunch frowned. \u2018Now I wonder where\u2026excuse me a\nmoment.\u2019 She went upstairs and it was some few minutes\nbefore she returned.\n\u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 she said breathlessly, \u2018my daily woman\nmust have put it aside with other clothes that were going to\nthe cleaners. It\u2019s taken me quite a long time to \ufb01nd it. Here\nit is. I\u2019ll do it up for you in brown paper.\u2019\nDisclaiming their protests she did so; then once more\ne\ufb00usively bidding her farewell the Eccleses departed.\nBunch went slowly back across the hall and entered the\nstudy. The Reverend Julian Harmon looked up and his brow\ncleared. He was composing a sermon and was fearing that\nhe\u2019d been led astray by the interest of the political relations\nbetween Judaea and Persia, in the reign of Cyrus.\n\u2018Yes, dear?\u2019 he said hopefully.\n\u2018Julian,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018What\u2019s Sanctuary exactly?\u2019\nJulian Harmon gratefully put aside his sermon paper.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 he said. \u2018Sanctuary in Roman and Greek temples\napplied to the cella in which stood the statue of a god. The\nLatin word for altar \u201cara\u201d also means protection.\u2019 He\ncontinued learnedly: \u2018In three hundred and ninety-nine A.D.\nthe right of sanctuary in Christian churches was \ufb01nally and\nde\ufb01nitely recognized. The earliest mention of the right of\n\n----Page Break----\nsanctuary in England is in the Code of Laws issued by\nEthelbert in A.D. six hundred\u2026\u2019\nHe continued for some time with his exposition but was,\nas often, disconcerted by his wife\u2019s reception of his erudite\npronouncement.\n\u2018Darling,\u2019 she said. \u2018You are sweet.\u2019\nBending over, she kissed him on the tip of his nose. Julian\nfelt rather like a dog who has been congratulated on\nperforming a clever trick.\n\u2018The Eccleses have been here,\u2019 said Bunch.\nThe vicar frowned. \u2018The Eccleses? I don\u2019t seem to\nremember\u2026\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t know them. They\u2019re the sister and her\nhusband of the man in the church.\u2019\n\u2018My dear, you ought to have called me.\u2019\n\u2018There wasn\u2019t any need,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018They were not in\nneed of consolation. I wonder now\u2026\u2019 She frowned. \u2018If I put a\ncasserole in the oven tomorrow, can you manage, Julian? I\nthink I shall go up to London for the sales.\u2019\n\u2018The sails?\u2019 Her husband looked at her blankly. \u2018Do you\nmean a yacht or a boat or something?\u2019\nBunch laughed. \u2018No, darling. There\u2019s a special white sale\nat Burrows and Portman\u2019s. You know, sheets, table cloths\nand towels and glass-cloths. I don\u2019t know what we do with\nour glass-cloths, the way they wear through. Besides,\u2019 she\nadded thoughtfully, \u2018I think I ought to go and see Aunt Jane.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nII\nThat sweet old lady, Miss Jane Marple, was enjoying the\ndelights of the metropolis for a fortnight, comfortably\ninstalled in her nephew\u2019s studio \ufb02at.\n\u2018So kind of dear Raymond,\u2019 she murmured. \u2018He and Joan\nhave gone to America for a fortnight and they insisted I\nshould come up here and enjoy myself. And now, dear\nBunch, do tell me what it is that\u2019s worrying you.\u2019\nBunch was Miss Marple\u2019s favourite godchild, and the old\nlady looked at her with great a\ufb00ection as Bunch, thrusting\nher best felt hat farther on the back of her head, started her\nstory.\nBunch\u2019s recital was concise and clear. Miss Marple\nnodded her head as Bunch \ufb01nished. \u2018I see,\u2019 she said. \u2018Yes, I\nsee.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s why I felt I had to see you,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018You see,\nnot being clever\u2014\u2019\n\u2018But you are clever, my dear.\u2019\n\u2018No, I\u2019m not. Not clever like Julian.\u2019\n\u2018Julian, of course, has a very solid intellect,\u2019 said Miss\nMarple.\n\u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Julian\u2019s got the intellect, but on\nthe other hand, I\u2019ve got the sense.\u2019\n\u2018You have a lot of common sense, Bunch, and you\u2019re very\nintelligent.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You see, I don\u2019t really know what I ought to do. I can\u2019t\nask Julian because\u2014well, I mean, Julian\u2019s so full of\nrectitude\u2026\u2019\nThis statement appeared to be perfectly understood by\nMiss Marple, who said, \u2018I know what you mean, dear. We\nwomen\u2014well, it\u2019s di\ufb00erent.\u2019 She went on. \u2018You told me what\nhappened, Bunch, but I\u2019d like to know \ufb01rst exactly what you\nthink.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s all wrong,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018The man who was there in\nthe church, dying, knew all about Sanctuary. He said it just\nthe way Julian would have said it. I mean, he was a well-\nread, educated man. And if he\u2019d shot himself, he wouldn\u2019t\ndrag himself to a church afterwards and say \u201csanctuary\u201d.\nSanctuary means that you\u2019re pursued, and when you get\ninto a church you\u2019re safe. Your pursuers can\u2019t touch you. At\none time even the law couldn\u2019t get at you.\u2019\nShe looked questioningly at Miss Marple. The latter\nnodded. Bunch went on, \u2018Those people, the Eccleses, were\nquite di\ufb00erent. Ignorant and coarse. And there\u2019s another\nthing. That watch\u2014the dead man\u2019s watch. It had the initials\nW.S. on the back of it. But inside\u2014I opened it\u2014in very small\nlettering there was \u201cTo Walter from his father\u201d and a date.\nWalter. But the Eccleses kept talking of him as William or\nBill.\u2019\nMiss Marple seemed about to speak but Bunch rushed\non. \u2018Oh, I know you\u2019re not always called the name you\u2019re\nbaptized by. I mean, I can understand that you might be\nchristened William and called \u201cPorgy\u201d or \u201cCarrots\u201d or\nsomething. But your sister wouldn\u2019t call you William or Bill if\nyour name was Walter.\u2019\n\u2018You mean that she wasn\u2019t his sister?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m quite sure she wasn\u2019t his sister. They were horrid\u2014\nboth of them. They came to the vicarage to get his things\nand to \ufb01nd out if he\u2019d said anything before he died. When I\nsaid he hadn\u2019t I saw it in their faces\u2014relief. I think myself,\u2019\n\ufb01nished Bunch, \u2018it was Eccles who shot him.\u2019\n\u2018Murder?\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Murder. That\u2019s why I came to you,\ndarling.\u2019\nBunch\u2019s remark might have seemed incongruous to an\nignorant listener, but in certain spheres Miss Marple had a\nreputation for dealing with murder.\n\u2018He said \u201cplease\u201d to me before he died,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018He\nwanted me to do something for him. The awful thing is I\u2019ve\nno idea what.\u2019\nMiss Marple considered for a moment or two, and then\npounced on the point that had already occurred to Bunch.\n\u2018But why was he there at all?\u2019 she asked.\n\u2018You mean,\u2019 said Bunch, \u2018if you wanted sanctuary you\nmight pop into a church anywhere. There\u2019s no need to take\na bus that only goes four times a day and come out to a\nlonely spot like ours for it.\u2019\n\u2018He must have come there for a purpose,\u2019 Miss Marple\nthought. \u2018He must have come to see someone. Chipping\nCleghorn\u2019s not a big place, Bunch. Surely you must have\nsome idea of who it was he came to see?\u2019\nBunch reviewed the inhabitants of her village in her mind\nbefore rather doubtfully shaking her head. \u2018In a way,\u2019 she\nsaid, \u2018it could be anybody.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018He never mentioned a name?\u2019\n\u2018He said Julian, or I thought he said Julian. It might have\nbeen Julia, I suppose. As far as I know, there isn\u2019t any Julia\nliving in Chipping Cleghorn.\u2019\nShe screwed up her eyes as she thought back to the\nscene. The man lying there on the chancel steps, the light\ncoming through the window with its jewels of red and blue\nlight.\n\u2018Jewels,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully.\n\u2018I\u2019m coming now,\u2019 said Bunch, \u2018to the most important\nthing of all. The reason why I\u2019ve really come here today. You\nsee, the Eccleses made a great fuss about having his coat.\nWe took it o\ufb00 when the doctor was seeing him. It was an\nold, shabby sort of coat\u2014there was no reason they should\nhave wanted it. They pretended it was sentimental, but that\nwas nonsense.\n\u2018Anyway, I went up to \ufb01nd it, and as I was just going up\nthe stairs I remembered how he\u2019d made a kind of picking\ngesture with his hand, as though he was fumbling with the\ncoat. So when I got hold of the coat I looked at it very\ncarefully and I saw that in one place the lining had been\nsewn up again with a di\ufb00erent thread. So I unpicked it and I\nfound a little piece of paper inside. I took it out and I sewed\nit up again properly with thread that matched. I was careful\nand I don\u2019t really think that the Eccleses would know I\u2019ve\ndone it. I don\u2019t think so, but I can\u2019t be sure. And I took the\ncoat down to them and made some excuse for the delay.\u2019\n\u2018The piece of paper?\u2019 asked Miss Marple.\nBunch opened her handbag. \u2018I didn\u2019t show it to Julian,\u2019\nshe said, \u2018because he would have said that I ought to have\n\n----Page Break----\ngiven it to the Eccleses. But I thought I\u2019d rather bring it to\nyou instead.\u2019\n\u2018A cloakroom ticket,\u2019 said Miss Marple, looking at it.\n\u2018Paddington Station.\u2019\n\u2018He had a return ticket to Paddington in his pocket,\u2019 said\nBunch.\nThe eyes of the two women met.\n\u2018This calls for action,\u2019 said Miss Marple briskly. \u2018But it\nwould be advisable, I think, to be careful. Would you have\nnoticed at all, Bunch dear, whether you were followed when\nyou came to London today?\u2019\n\u2018Followed!\u2019 exclaimed Bunch. \u2018You don\u2019t think\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Well, I think it\u2019s possible,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018When\nanything is possible, I think we ought to take precautions.\u2019\nShe rose with a brisk movement. \u2018You came up here\nostensibly, my dear, to go to the sales. I think the right thing\nto do, therefore, would be for us to go to the sales. But\nbefore we set out, we might put one or two little\narrangements in hand. I don\u2019t suppose,\u2019 Miss Marple added\nobscurely, \u2018that I shall need the old speckled tweed with the\nbeaver collar just at present.\u2019\nIt was about an hour and a half later that the two ladies,\nrather the worse for wear and battered in appearance, and\nboth clasping parcels of hardly-won household linen, sat\ndown at a small and sequestered hostelry called the Apple\nBough to restore their forces with steak and kidney pudding\nfollowed by apple tart and custard.\n\u2018Really a prewar quality face towel,\u2019 gasped Miss Marple,\nslightly out of breath. \u2018With a J on it, too. So fortunate that\n\n----Page Break----\nRaymond\u2019s wife\u2019s name is Joan. I shall put them aside until I\nreally need them and then they will do for her if I pass on\nsooner than I expect.\u2019\n\u2018I really did need the glass-cloths,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018And they\nwere very cheap, though not as cheap as the ones that\nwoman with the ginger hair managed to snatch from me.\u2019\nA smart young woman with a lavish application of rouge\nand lipstick entered the Apple Bough at that moment. After\nlooking around vaguely for a moment or two, she hurried to\ntheir table. She laid down an envelope by Miss Marple\u2019s\nelbow.\n\u2018There you are, miss,\u2019 she said briskly.\n\u2018Oh, thank you, Gladys,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018Thank you\nvery much. So kind of you.\u2019\n\u2018Always pleased to oblige, I\u2019m sure,\u2019 said Gladys. \u2018Ernie\nalways says to me, \u201cEverything what\u2019s good you learned\nfrom that Miss Marple of yours that you were in service\nwith,\u201d and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m always glad to oblige you, miss.\u2019\n\u2018Such a dear girl,\u2019 said Miss Marple as Gladys departed\nagain. \u2018Always so willing and so kind.\u2019\nShe looked inside the envelope and then passed it on to\nBunch. \u2018Now be very careful, dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018By the way, is\nthere still that nice young inspector at Melchester that I\nremember?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018I expect so.\u2019\n\u2018Well, if not,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully. \u2018I can always\nring up the Chief Constable. I think he would remember me.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Of course he\u2019d remember you,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Everybody\nwould remember you. You\u2019re quite unique.\u2019 She rose.\nArrived at Paddington, Bunch went to the luggage o\ufb03ce\nand produced the cloakroom ticket. A moment or two later a\nrather shabby old suitcase was passed across to her, and\ncarrying this she made her way to the platform.\nThe journey home was uneventful. Bunch rose as the\ntrain approached Chipping Cleghorn and picked up the old\nsuitcase. She had just left her carriage when a man,\nsprinting along the platform, suddenly seized the suitcase\nfrom her hand and rushed o\ufb00 with it.\n\u2018Stop!\u2019 Bunch yelled. \u2018Stop him, stop him. He\u2019s taken my\nsuitcase.\u2019\nThe ticket collector who, at this rural station, was a man\nof somewhat slow processes, had just begun to say, \u2018Now,\nlook here, you can\u2019t do that\u2014\u2019 when a smart blow on the\nchest pushed him aside, and the man with the suitcase\nrushed out from the station. He made his way towards a\nwaiting car. Tossing the suitcase in, he was about to climb\nafter it, but before he could move a hand fell on his\nshoulder, and the voice of Police Constable Abel said, \u2018Now\nthen, what\u2019s all this?\u2019\nBunch arrived, panting, from the station. \u2018He snatched\nmy suitcase. I just got out of the train with it.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense,\u2019 said the man. \u2018I don\u2019t know what this lady\nmeans. It\u2019s my suitcase. I just got out of the train with it.\u2019\nHe looked at Bunch with a bovine and impartial stare.\nNobody would have guessed that Police Constable Abel and\nMrs Harmon spent long half-hours in Police Constable Abel\u2019s\n\n----Page Break----\no\ufb00-time discussing the respective merits of manure and\nbone meal for rose bushes.\n\u2018You say, madam, that this is your suitcase?\u2019 said Police\nConstable Abel.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018De\ufb01nitely.\u2019\n\u2018And you, sir?\u2019\n\u2018I say this suitcase is mine.\u2019\nThe man was tall, dark and well dressed, with a drawling\nvoice and a superior manner. A feminine voice from inside\nthe car said, \u2018Of course it\u2019s your suitcase, Edwin. I don\u2019t\nknow what this woman means.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ll have to get this clear,\u2019 said Police Constable Abel.\n\u2018If it\u2019s your suitcase, madam, what do you say is inside it?\u2019\n\u2018Clothes,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018A long speckled coat with a\nbeaver collar, two wool jumpers and a pair of shoes.\u2019\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s clear enough,\u2019 said Police Constable Abel. He\nturned to the other.\n\u2018I am a theatrical costumer,\u2019 said the dark man\nimportantly. \u2018This suitcase contains theatrical properties\nwhich I brought down here for an amateur performance.\u2019\n\u2018Right, sir,\u2019 said Police Constable Abel. \u2018Well, we\u2019ll just\nlook inside, shall we, and see? We can go along to the police\nstation, or if you\u2019re in a hurry we\u2019ll take the suitcase back to\nthe station and open it there.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019ll suit me,\u2019 said the dark man. \u2018My name is Moss, by\nthe way, Edwin Moss.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThe police constable, holding the suitcase, went back\ninto the station. \u2018Just taking this into the parcels o\ufb03ce,\nGeorge,\u2019 he said to the ticket collector.\nPolice Constable Abel laid the suitcase on the counter of\nthe parcels o\ufb03ce and pushed back the clasp. The case was\nnot locked. Bunch and Mr Edwin Moss stood on either side of\nhim, their eyes regarding each other vengefully.\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 said Police Constable Abel, as he pushed up the lid.\nInside, neatly folded, was a long rather shabby tweed\ncoat with a beaver fur collar. There were also two wool\njumpers and a pair of country shoes.\n\u2018Exactly as you say, madam,\u2019 said Police Constable Abel,\nturning to Bunch.\nNobody could have said that Mr Edwin Moss under-did\nthings. His dismay and compunction were magni\ufb01cent.\n\u2018I do apologize,\u2019 he said. \u2018I really do apologize. Please\nbelieve me, dear lady, when I tell you how very, very sorry I\nam. Unpardonable\u2014quite unpardonable\u2014my behaviour has\nbeen.\u2019 He looked at his watch. \u2018I must rush now. Probably\nmy suitcase has gone on the train.\u2019 Raising his hat once\nmore, he said meltingly to Bunch, \u2018Do, do forgive me,\u2019 and\nrushed hurriedly out of the parcels o\ufb03ce.\n\u2018Are you going to let him get away?\u2019 asked Bunch in a\nconspiratorial whisper to Police Constable Abel.\nThe latter slowly closed a bovine eye in a wink.\n\u2018He won\u2019t get too far, ma\u2019am,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s to say he\nwon\u2019t get far unobserved, if you take my meaning.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 said Bunch, relieved.\n\u2018That old lady\u2019s been on the phone,\u2019 said Police Constable\nAbel, \u2018the one as was down here a few years ago. Bright she\nis, isn\u2019t she? But there\u2019s been a lot cooking up all today.\nShouldn\u2019t wonder if the inspector or sergeant was out to see\nyou about it tomorrow morning.\u2019\nIII\nIt was the inspector who came, the Inspector Craddock\nwhom Miss Marple remembered. He greeted Bunch with a\nsmile as an old friend.\n\u2018Crime in Chipping Cleghorn again,\u2019 he said cheerfully.\n\u2018You don\u2019t lack for sensation here, do you, Mrs Harmon?\u2019\n\u2018I could do with rather less,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018Have you come\nto ask me questions or are you going to tell me things for a\nchange?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll tell you some things \ufb01rst,\u2019 said the inspector. \u2018To\nbegin with, Mr and Mrs Eccles have been having an eye kept\non them for some time. There\u2019s reason to believe they\u2019ve\nbeen connected with several robberies in this part of the\nworld. For another thing, although Mrs Eccles has a brother\ncalled Sandbourne who has recently come back from\nabroad, the man you found dying in the church yesterday\nwas de\ufb01nitely not Sandbourne.\u2019\n\u2018I knew that he wasn\u2019t,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018His name was\nWalter, to begin with, not William.\u2019\nThe inspector nodded. \u2018His name was Walter St John, and\nhe escaped forty-eight hours ago from Charrington Prison.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Bunch softly to herself, \u2018he was being\nhunted down by the law, and he took sanctuary.\u2019 Then she\nasked, \u2018What had he done?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll have to go back rather a long way. It\u2019s a complicated\nstory. Several years ago there was a certain dancer doing\nturns at the music halls. I don\u2019t expect you\u2019ll have ever\nheard of her, but she specialized in an Arabian Night turn,\n\u201cAladdin in the Cave of Jewels\u201d it was called. She wore bits\nof rhinestone and not much else.\n\u2018She wasn\u2019t much of a dancer, I believe, but she was\u2014\nwell\u2014attractive. Anyway, a certain Asiatic royalty fell for her\nin a big way. Amongst other things he gave her a very\nmagni\ufb01cent emerald necklace.\u2019\n\u2018The historic jewels of a Rajah?\u2019 murmured Bunch\necstatically.\nInspector Craddock coughed. \u2018Well, a rather more\nmodern version, Mrs Harmon. The a\ufb00air didn\u2019t last very\nlong, broke up when our potentate\u2019s attention was captured\nby a certain \ufb01lm star whose demands were not quite so\nmodest.\n\u2018Zobeida, to give the dancer her stage name, hung on to\nthe necklace, and in due course it was stolen. It disappeared\nfrom her dressing-room at the theatre, and there was a\nlingering suspicion in the minds of the authorities that she\nherself might have engineered its disappearance. Such\nthings have been known as a publicity stunt, or indeed from\nmore dishonest motives.\n\u2018The necklace was never recovered, but during the\ncourse of the investigation the attention of the police was\ndrawn to this man, Walter St John. He was a man of\neducation and breeding who had come down in the world,\n\n----Page Break----\nand who was employed as a working jeweller with a rather\nobscure \ufb01rm which was suspected of acting as a fence for\njewel robberies.\n\u2018There was evidence that this necklace had passed\nthrough his hands. It was, however, in connection with the\ntheft of some other jewellery that he was \ufb01nally brought to\ntrial and convicted and sent to prison. He had not very\nmuch longer to serve, so his escape was rather a surprise.\u2019\n\u2018But why did he come here?\u2019 asked Bunch.\n\u2018We\u2019d like to know that very much, Mrs Harmon.\nFollowing up his trial, it seems that he went \ufb01rst to London.\nHe didn\u2019t visit any of his old associates but he visited an\nelderly woman, a Mrs Jacobs who had formerly been a\ntheatrical dresser. She won\u2019t say a word of what he came\nfor, but according to other lodgers in the house he left\ncarrying a suitcase.\u2019\n\u2018I see,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018He left it in the cloakroom at\nPaddington and then he came down here.\u2019\n\u2018By that time,\u2019 said Inspector Craddock, \u2018Eccles and the\nman who calls himself Edwin Moss were on his trail. They\nwanted that suitcase. They saw him get on the bus. They\nmust have driven out in a car ahead of him and been\nwaiting for him when he left the bus.\u2019\n\u2018And he was murdered?\u2019 said Bunch.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Craddock. \u2018He was shot. It was Eccles\u2019s\nrevolver, but I rather fancy it was Moss who did the\nshooting. Now, Mrs Harmon, what we want to know is,\nwhere is the suitcase that Walter St John actually deposited\nat Paddington Station?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nBunch grinned. \u2018I expect Aunt Jane\u2019s got it by now,\u2019 she\nsaid. \u2018Miss Marple, I mean. That was her plan. She sent a\nformer maid of hers with a suitcase packed with her things\nto the cloakroom at Paddington and we exchanged tickets. I\ncollected her suitcase and brought it down by train. She\nseemed to expect that an attempt would be made to get it\nfrom me.\u2019\nIt was Inspector Craddock\u2019s turn to grin. \u2018So she said\nwhen she rang up. I\u2019m driving up to London to see her. Do\nyou want to come, too, Mrs Harmon?\u2019\n\u2018Wel-l,\u2019 said Bunch, considering. \u2018Wel-l, as a matter of\nfact, it\u2019s very fortunate. I had a toothache last night so I\nreally ought to go to London to see the dentist, oughtn\u2019t I?\u2019\n\u2018De\ufb01nitely,\u2019 said Inspector Craddock\u2026\nMiss Marple looked from Inspector Craddock\u2019s face to the\neager face of Bunch Harmon. The suitcase lay on the table.\n\u2018Of course, I haven\u2019t opened it,\u2019 the old lady said. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t\ndream of doing such a thing till somebody o\ufb03cial arrived.\nBesides,\u2019 she added, with a demurely mischievous Victorian\nsmile, \u2018it\u2019s locked.\u2019\n\u2018Like to make a guess at what\u2019s inside, Miss Marple?\u2019\nasked the inspector.\n\u2018I should imagine, you know,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018that it\nwould be Zobeida\u2019s theatrical costumes. Would you like a\nchisel, Inspector?\u2019\nThe chisel soon did its work. Both women gave a slight\ngasp as the lid \ufb02ew up. The sunlight coming through the\nwindow lit up what seemed like an inexhaustible treasure of\nsparkling jewels, red, blue, green, orange.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Aladdin\u2019s Cave,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018The \ufb02ashing jewels\nthe girl wore to dance.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Inspector Craddock. \u2018Now, what\u2019s so precious\nabout it, do you think, that a man was murdered to get hold\nof it?\u2019\n\u2018She was a shrewd girl, I expect,\u2019 said Miss Marple\nthoughtfully. \u2018She\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she, Inspector?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, died three years ago.\u2019\n\u2018She had this valuable emerald necklace,\u2019 said Miss\nMarple, musingly. \u2018Had the stones taken out of their setting\nand fastened here and there on her theatrical costume,\nwhere everyone would take them for merely coloured\nrhinestones. Then she had a replica made of the real\nnecklace, and that, of course, was what was stolen. No\nwonder it never came on the market. The thief soon\ndiscovered the stones were false.\u2019\n\u2018Here is an envelope,\u2019 said Bunch, pulling aside some of\nthe glittering stones.\nInspector Craddock took it from her and extracted two\no\ufb03cial-looking papers from it. He read aloud, \u2018 \u201cMarriage\nCerti\ufb01cate between Walter Edmund St John and Mary Moss.\u201d\nThat was Zobeida\u2019s real name.\u2019\n\u2018So they were married,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018I see.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s the other?\u2019 asked Bunch.\n\u2018A birth certi\ufb01cate of a daughter, Jewel.\u2019\n\u2018Jewel?\u2019 cried Bunch. \u2018Why, of course. Jewel! Jill! That\u2019s it.\nI see now why he came to Chipping Cleghorn. That\u2019s what\n\n----Page Break----\nhe was trying to say to me. Jewel. The Mundys, you know.\nLaburnum Cottage. They look after a little girl for someone.\nThey\u2019re devoted to her. She\u2019s been like their own\ngranddaughter. Yes, I remember now, her name was Jewel,\nonly, of course, they call her Jill.\n\u2018Mrs Mundy had a stroke about a week ago, and the old\nman\u2019s been very ill with pneumonia. They were both going\nto go to the in\ufb01rmary. I\u2019ve been trying hard to \ufb01nd a good\nhome for Jill somewhere. I didn\u2019t want her taken away to an\ninstitution.\n\u2018I suppose her father heard about it in prison and he\nmanaged to break away and get hold of this suitcase from\nthe old dresser he or his wife left it with. I suppose if the\njewels really belonged to her mother, they can be used for\nthe child now.\u2019\n\u2018I should imagine so, Mrs Harmon. If they\u2019re here.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, they\u2019ll be here all right,\u2019 said Miss Marple\ncheerfully\u2026\nIV\n\u2018Thank goodness you\u2019re back, dear,\u2019 said the Reverend\nJulian Harmon, greeting his wife with a\ufb00ection and a sigh of\ncontent. \u2018Mrs Burt always tries to do her best when you\u2019re\naway, but she really gave me some very peculiar \ufb01sh-cakes\nfor lunch. I didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings so I gave them to\nTiglath Pileser, but even he wouldn\u2019t eat them so I had to\nthrow them out of the window.\u2019\n\u2018Tiglath Pileser,\u2019 said Bunch, stroking the vicarage cat,\nwho was purring against her knee, \u2018is very particular about\n\n----Page Break----\nwhat \ufb01sh he eats. I often tell him he\u2019s got a proud stomach!\u2019\n\u2018And your tooth, dear? Did you have it seen to?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bunch. \u2018It didn\u2019t hurt much, and I went to see\nAunt Jane again, too\u2026\u2019\n\u2018Dear old thing,\u2019 said Julian. \u2018I hope she\u2019s not failing at\nall.\u2019\n\u2018Not in the least,\u2019 said Bunch, with a grin.\nThe following morning Bunch took a fresh supply of\nchrysanthemums to the church. The sun was once more\npouring through the east window, and Bunch stood in the\njewelled light on the chancel steps. She said very softly\nunder her breath, \u2018Your little girl will be all right. I\u2019ll see that\nshe is. I promise.\u2019\nThen she tidied up the church, slipped into a pew and\nknelt for a few moments to say her prayers before returning\nto the vicarage to attack the piled-up chores of two\nneglected days.\n\n----Page Break----\nStrange Jest\nI\n\u2018And this,\u2019 said Jane Helier, completing her introductions, \u2018is\nMiss Marple!\u2019\nBeing an actress, she was able to make her point. It was\nclearly the climax, the triumphant \ufb01nale! Her tone was\nequally compounded of reverent awe and triumph.\nThe odd part of it was that the object thus proudly\nproclaimed was merely a gentle, fussy-looking, elderly\nspinster. In the eyes of the two young people who had just,\nby Jane\u2019s good o\ufb03ces, made her acquaintance, there\nshowed incredulity and a tinge of dismay. They were nice-\nlooking people; the girl, Charmian Stroud, slim and dark\u2014\nthe man, Edward Rossiter, a fair-haired, amiable young\ngiant.\nCharmian said a little breathlessly. \u2018Oh! We\u2019re awfully\npleased to meet you.\u2019 But there was doubt in her eyes. She\n\ufb02ung a quick, questioning glance at Jane Helier.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Darling,\u2019 said Jane, answering the glance, \u2018she\u2019s\nabsolutely marvellous. Leave it all to her. I told you I\u2019d get\nher here and I have.\u2019 She added to Miss Marple, \u2018You\u2019ll \ufb01x it\nfor them, I know. It will be easy for you.\u2019\nMiss Marple turned her placid, china-blue eyes towards\nMr Rossiter. \u2018Won\u2019t you tell me,\u2019 she said, \u2018what all this is\nabout?\u2019\n\u2018Jane\u2019s a friend of ours,\u2019 Charmian broke in impatiently.\n\u2018Edward and I are in rather a \ufb01x. Jane said if we would come\nto her party, she\u2019d introduce us to someone who was\u2014who\nwould\u2014who could\u2014\u2019\nEdward came to the rescue. \u2018Jane tells us you\u2019re the last\nword in sleuths, Miss Marple!\u2019\nThe old lady\u2019s eyes twinkled, but she protested modestly.\n\u2018Oh, no, no! Nothing of the kind. It\u2019s just that living in a\nvillage as I do, one gets to know so much about human\nnature. But really you have made me quite curious. Do tell\nme your problem.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s terribly hackneyed\u2014just buried treasure,\u2019\nsaid Edward.\n\u2018Indeed? But that sounds most exciting!\u2019\n\u2018I know. Like Treasure Island. But our problem lacks the\nusual romantic touches. No point on a chart indicated by a\nskull and crossbones, no directions like \u201cfour paces to the\nleft, west by north\u201d. It\u2019s horribly prosaic\u2014just where we\nought to dig.\u2019\n\u2018Have you tried at all?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I should say we\u2019d dug about two solid square acres! The\nwhole place is ready to be turned into a market garden.\nWe\u2019re just discussing whether to grow vegetable marrows or\npotatoes.\u2019\nCharmian said rather abruptly, \u2018May we really tell you all\nabout it?\u2019\n\u2018But, of course, my dear.\u2019\n\u2018Then let\u2019s \ufb01nd a peaceful spot. Come on, Edward.\u2019 She\nled the way out of the overcrowded and smoke-laden room,\nand they went up the stairs, to a small sitting-room on the\nsecond \ufb02oor.\nWhen they were seated, Charmian began abruptly. \u2018Well,\nhere goes! The story starts with Uncle Mathew, uncle\u2014or\nrather, great-great-uncle\u2014to both of us. He was incredibly\nancient. Edward and I were his only relations. He was fond\nof us and always declared that when he died he would leave\nhis money between us. Well, he died last March and left\neverything he had to be divided equally between Edward\nand myself. What I\u2019ve just said sounds rather callous\u2014I\ndon\u2019t mean that it was right that he died\u2014actually we were\nvery fond of him. But he\u2019d been ill for some time.\n\u2018The point is that the \u201ceverything\u201d he left turned out to\nbe practically nothing at all. And that, frankly, was a bit of a\nblow to us both, wasn\u2019t it, Edward?\u2019\nThe amiable Edward agreed. \u2018You see,\u2019 he said, \u2018we\u2019d\ncounted on it a bit. I mean, when you know a good bit of\nmoney is coming to you, you don\u2019t\u2014well\u2014buckle down and\ntry to make it yourself. I\u2019m in the army\u2014not got anything to\nspeak of outside my pay\u2014and Charmian herself hasn\u2019t got a\nbean. She works as a stage manager in a repertory theatre\n\u2014quite interesting, and she enjoys it\u2014but no money in it.\n\n----Page Break----\nWe\u2019d counted on getting married, but weren\u2019t worried about\nthe money side of it because we both knew we\u2019d be jolly\nwell o\ufb00 some day.\u2019\n\u2018And now, you see, we\u2019re not!\u2019 said Charmian. \u2018What\u2019s\nmore, Ansteys\u2014that\u2019s the family place, and Edward and I\nboth love it\u2014will probably have to be sold. And Edward and I\nfeel we just can\u2019t bear that! But if we don\u2019t \ufb01nd Uncle\nMathew\u2019s money, we shall have to sell.\u2019\nEdward said, \u2018You know, Charmian, we still haven\u2019t come\nto the vital point.\u2019\n\u2018Well, you talk, then.\u2019\nEdward turned to Miss Marple. \u2018It\u2019s like this, you see. As\nUncle Mathew grew older, he got more and more suspicious.\nHe didn\u2019t trust anybody.\u2019\n\u2018Very wise of him,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018The depravity of\nhuman nature is unbelievable.\u2019\n\u2018Well, you may be right. Anyway, Uncle Mathew thought\nso. He had a friend who lost his money in a bank, and\nanother friend who was ruined by an absconding solicitor,\nand he lost some money himself in a fraudulent company.\nHe got so that he used to hold forth at great length that the\nonly safe and sane thing to do was to convert your money\ninto solid bullion and bury it.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018I begin to see.\u2019\n\u2018Yes. Friends argued with him, pointed out that he\u2019d get\nno interest that way, but he held that that didn\u2019t really\nmatter. The bulk of your money, he said, should be \u201ckept in\na box under the bed or buried in the garden\u201d. Those were\nhis words.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nCharmian went on. \u2018And when he died, he left hardly\nanything at all in securities, though he was very rich. So we\nthink that that\u2019s what he must have done.\u2019\nEdward explained. \u2018We found that he had sold securities\nand drawn out large sums of money from time to time, and\nnobody knows what he did with them. But it seems probable\nthat he lived up to his principles, and that he did buy gold\nand bury it.\u2019\n\u2018He didn\u2019t say anything before he died? Leave any paper?\nNo letter?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the maddening part of it. He didn\u2019t. He\u2019d been\nunconscious for some days, but he rallied before he died. He\nlooked at us both and chuckled\u2014a faint, weak little chuckle.\nHe said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right, my pretty pair of doves.\u201d And\nthen he tapped his eye\u2014his right eye\u2014and winked at us.\nAnd then\u2014he died. Poor old Uncle Mathew.\u2019\n\u2018He tapped his eye,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully.\nEdward said eagerly. \u2018Does that convey anything to you?\nIt made me think of an Arsene Lupin story where there was\nsomething hidden in a man\u2019s glass eye. But Uncle Mathew\ndidn\u2019t have a glass eye.\u2019\nMiss Marple shook her head. \u2018No\u2014I can\u2019t think of\nanything at the moment.\u2019\nCharmian said disappointedly, \u2018Jane told us you\u2019d say at\nonce where to dig!\u2019\nMiss Marple smiled. \u2018I\u2019m not quite a conjurer, you know. I\ndidn\u2019t know your uncle, or what sort of man he was, and I\ndon\u2019t know the house or the grounds.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nCharmian said, \u2018If you did know them?\u2019\n\u2018Well, it must be quite simple, really, mustn\u2019t it?\u2019 said\nMiss Marple.\n\u2018Simple!\u2019 said Charmian. \u2018You come down to Ansteys and\nsee if it\u2019s simple!\u2019\nIt is possible that she did not mean the invitation to be\ntaken seriously, but Miss Marple said briskly, \u2018Well, really,\nmy dear, that\u2019s very kind of you. I\u2019ve always wanted to have\nthe chance of looking for buried treasure. And,\u2019 she added,\nlooking at them with a beaming, late-Victorian smile, \u2018with a\nlove interest, too!\u2019\nII\n\u2018You see!\u2019 said Charmian, gesturing dramatically.\nThey had just completed a grand tour of Ansteys. They\nhad been round the kitchen garden\u2014heavily trenched. They\nhad been through the little woods, where every important\ntree had been dug round, and had gazed sadly on the pitted\nsurface of the once smooth lawn. They had been up to the\nattic, where old trunks and chests had been ri\ufb02ed of their\ncontents. They had been down to the cellars, where\n\ufb02agstones had been heaved unwillingly from their sockets.\nThey had measured and tapped walls, and Miss Marple had\nbeen shown every antique piece of furniture that contained\nor could be suspected of containing a secret drawer.\nOn a table in the morning-room there was a heap of\npapers\u2014all the papers that the late Mathew Stroud had left.\nNot one had been destroyed, and Charmian and Edward\nwere wont to return to them again and again, earnestly\n\n----Page Break----\nperusing bills, invitations, and business correspondence in\nthe hope of spotting a hitherto unnoticed clue.\n\u2018Can you think of anywhere we haven\u2019t looked?\u2019\ndemanded Charmian hopefully.\nMiss Marple shook her head. \u2018You seem to have been\nvery thorough, my dear. Perhaps, if I may say so, just a little\ntoo thorough. I always think, you know, that one should\nhave a plan. It\u2019s like my friend, Mrs Eldritch, she had such a\nnice little maid, polished linoleum beautifully, but she was\nso thorough that she polished the bathroom \ufb02oor too much,\nand as Mrs Eldritch was stepping out of the bath the cork\nmat slipped from under her, and she had a very nasty fall\nand actually broke her leg! Most awkward, because the\nbathroom door was locked, of course, and the gardener had\nto get a ladder and come in through the window\u2014terribly\ndistressing to Mrs Eldritch, who had always been a very\nmodest woman.\u2019\nEdward moved restlessly.\nMiss Marple said quickly, \u2018Please forgive me. So apt, I\nknow, to \ufb02y o\ufb00 at a tangent. But one thing does remind one\nof another. And sometimes that is helpful. All I was trying to\nsay was that perhaps if we tried to sharpen our wits and\nthink of a likely place\u2014\u2019\nEdward said crossly, \u2018You think of one, Miss Marple.\nCharmian\u2019s brains and mine are now only beautiful blanks!\u2019\n\u2018Dear, dear. Of course\u2014most tiring for you. If you don\u2019t\nmind I\u2019ll just look through all this.\u2019 She indicated the papers\non the table. \u2018That is, if there\u2019s nothing private\u2014I don\u2019t want\nto appear to pry.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh, that\u2019s all right. But I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t \ufb01nd\nanything.\u2019\nShe sat down by the table and methodically worked\nthrough the sheaf of documents. As she replaced each one,\nshe sorted them automatically into tidy little heaps. When\nshe had \ufb01nished she sat staring in front of her for some\nminutes.\nEdward asked, not without a touch of malice, \u2018Well, Miss\nMarple?\u2019\nMiss Marple came to herself with a little start. \u2018I beg your\npardon. Most helpful.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve found something relevant?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, nothing like that, but I do believe I know what\nsort of man your Uncle Mathew was. Rather like my own\nUncle Henry, I think. Fond of rather obvious jokes. A\nbachelor, evidently\u2014I wonder why\u2014perhaps an early\ndisappointment? Methodical up to a point, but not very fond\nof being tied up\u2014so few bachelors are!\u2019\nBehind Miss Marple\u2019s back, Charmian made a sign to\nEdward. It said, She\u2019s ga-ga.\nMiss Marple was continuing happily to talk of her\ndeceased Uncle Henry. \u2018Very fond of puns, he was. And to\nsome people, puns are most annoying. A mere play upon\nwords may be very irritating. He was a suspicious man, too.\nAlways was convinced the servants were robbing him. And\nsometimes, of course, they were, but not always. It grew\nupon him, poor man. Towards the end he suspected them of\ntampering with his food, and \ufb01nally refused to eat anything\nbut boiled eggs! Said nobody could tamper with the inside\nof a boiled egg. Dear Uncle Henry, he used to be such a\n\n----Page Break----\nmerry soul at one time\u2014very fond of his co\ufb00ee after dinner.\nHe always used to say, \u201cThis co\ufb00ee is very Moorish,\u201d\nmeaning, you know, that he\u2019d like a little more.\u2019\nEdward felt that if he heard any more about Uncle Henry\nhe\u2019d go mad.\n\u2018Fond of young people, too,\u2019 went on Miss Marple, \u2018but\ninclined to tease them a little, if you know what I mean.\nUsed to put bags of sweets where a child just couldn\u2019t reach\nthem.\u2019\nCasting politeness aside, Charmian said, \u2018I think he\nsounds horrible!\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, dear, just an old bachelor, you know, and not\nused to children. And he wasn\u2019t at all stupid, really. He used\nto keep a good deal of money in the house, and he had a\nsafe put in. Made a great fuss about it\u2014and how very secure\nit was. As a result of his talking so much, burglars broke in\none night and actually cut a hole in the safe with a chemical\ndevice.\u2019\n\u2018Served him right,\u2019 said Edward.\n\u2018Oh, but there was nothing in the safe,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018You see, he really kept the money somewhere else\u2014behind\nsome volumes of sermons in the library, as a matter of fact.\nHe said people never took a book of that kind out of the\nshelf!\u2019\nEdward interrupted excitedly. \u2018I say, that\u2019s an idea. What\nabout the library?\u2019\nBut Charmian shook a scornful head. \u2018Do you think I\nhadn\u2019t thought of that? I went through all the books Tuesday\n\n----Page Break----\nof last week, when you went o\ufb00 to Portsmouth. Took them\nall out, shook them. Nothing there.\u2019\nEdward sighed. Then, rousing himself, he endeavoured to\nrid himself tactfully of their disappointing guest. \u2018It\u2019s been\nawfully good of you to come down as you have and try to\nhelp us. Sorry it\u2019s been all a wash-out. Feel we trespassed a\nlot on your time. However\u2014I\u2019ll get the car out, and you\u2019ll be\nable to catch the three-thirty\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018but we\u2019ve got to \ufb01nd the money,\nhaven\u2019t we? You mustn\u2019t give up, Mr Rossiter. \u201cIf at \ufb01rst you\ndon\u2019t succeed, try, try, try again.\u201d \u2019\n\u2018You mean you\u2019re going to\u2014go on trying?\u2019\n\u2018Strictly speaking,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018I haven\u2019t begun yet.\n\u201cFirst catch your hare\u2014\u201d as Mrs Beaton says in her cookery\nbook\u2014a wonderful book but terribly expensive; most of the\nrecipes begin, \u201cTake a quart of cream and a dozen eggs.\u201d\nLet me see, where was I? Oh, yes. Well, we have, so to\nspeak, caught our hare\u2014the hare being, of course, your\nUncle Mathew, and we\u2019ve only got to decide now where he\nwould have hidden the money. It ought to be quite simple.\u2019\n\u2018Simple?\u2019 demanded Charmian.\n\u2018Oh, yes, dear. I\u2019m sure he would have done the obvious\nthing. A secret drawer\u2014that\u2019s my solution.\u2019\nEdward said dryly, \u2018You couldn\u2019t put bars of gold in a\nsecret drawer.\u2019\n\u2018No, no, of course not. But there\u2019s no reason to believe\nthe money is in gold.\u2019\n\u2018He always used to say\u2014\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018So did my Uncle Henry about his safe! So I should\nstrongly suspect that that was just a blind. Diamonds\u2014now\nthey could be in a secret drawer quite easily.\u2019\n\u2018But we\u2019ve looked in all the secret drawers. We had a\ncabinetmaker over to examine the furniture.\u2019\n\u2018Did you, dear? That was clever of you. I should suggest\nyour uncle\u2019s own desk would be the most likely. Was it the\ntall escritoire against the wall there?\u2019\n\u2018Yes. And I\u2019ll show you.\u2019 Charmian went over to it. She\ntook down the \ufb02ap. Inside were pigeonholes and little\ndrawers. She opened a small door in the centre and touched\na spring inside the left-hand drawer. The bottom of the\ncentre recess clicked and slid forward. Charmian drew it out,\nrevealing a shallow well beneath. It was empty.\n\u2018Now isn\u2019t that a coincidence?\u2019 exclaimed Miss Marple.\n\u2018Uncle Henry had a desk just like this, only his was burr\nwalnut and this is mahogany.\u2019\n\u2018At any rate,\u2019 said Charmian, \u2018there\u2019s nothing there, as\nyou can see.\u2019\n\u2018I expect,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018your cabinetmaker was a\nyoung man. He didn\u2019t know everything. People were very\nartful when they made hiding-places in those days. There\u2019s\nsuch a thing as a secret inside a secret.\u2019\nShe extracted a hairpin from her neat bun of grey hair.\nStraightening it out, she stuck the point into what appeared\nto be a tiny wormhole in one side of the secret recess. With\na little di\ufb03culty she pulled out a small drawer. In it was a\nbundle of faded letters and a folded paper.\n\n----Page Break----\nEdward and Charmian pounced on the \ufb01nd together. With\ntrembling \ufb01ngers Edward unfolded the paper. He dropped it\nwith an exclamation of disgust.\n\u2018A damned cookery recipe. Baked ham!\u2019\nCharmian was untying a ribbon that held the letters\ntogether. She drew one out and glanced at it. \u2018Love letters!\u2019\nMiss \nMarple \nreacted \nwith \nVictorian \ngusto. \n\u2018How\ninteresting! Perhaps the reason your uncle never married.\u2019\nCharmian read aloud:\n\u2018 \u201cMy ever dear Mathew, I must confess that the time\nseems long indeed since I received your last letter. I\ntry to occupy myself with the various tasks allotted to\nme, and often say to myself that I am indeed\nfortunate to see so much of the globe, though little\ndid I think when I went to America that I should\nvoyage o\ufb00 to these far islands!\u14fc\u14fc \u2019\nCharmain broke o\ufb00. \u2018Where is it from? Oh! Hawaii!\u2019 She\nwent on:\n\u2018 \u201cAlas, these natives are still far from seeing the light.\nThey are in an unclothed and savage state and spend\nmost of their time swimming and dancing, adorning\nthemselves with garlands of \ufb02owers. Mr Gray has\nmade some converts but it is uphill work, and he and\nMrs Gray get sadly discouraged. I try to do all I can to\ncheer and encourage him, but I, too, am often sad for\na reason you can guess, dear Mathew. Alas, absence\nis a severe trial for a loving heart. Your renewed vows\nand protestations of a\ufb00ection cheered me greatly.\n\n----Page Break----\nNow and always you have my faithful and devoted\nheart, dear Mathew, and I remain\u2014Your true love,\nBetty Martin.\n\u2018 \u201cPS\u2014I address my letter under cover to our\nmutual friend, Matilda Graves, as usual. I hope heaven\nwill pardon this little subterfuge.\u201d \u2019\nEdward whistled. \u2018A female missionary! So that was Uncle\nMathew\u2019s romance. I wonder why they never married?\u2019\n\u2018She seems to have gone all over the world,\u2019 said\nCharmian, looking through the letters. \u2018Mauritius\u2014all sorts\nof places. Probably died of yellow fever or something.\u2019\nA gentle chuckle made them start. Miss Marple was\napparently much amused. \u2018Well, well,\u2019 she said. \u2018Fancy that,\nnow!\u2019\nShe was reading the recipe for baked ham. Seeing their\nenquiring glances, she read out: \u2018 \u201cBaked ham with spinach.\nTake a nice piece of gammon, stu\ufb00 with cloves, and cover\nwith brown sugar. Bake in a slow oven. Serve with a border\nof pureed spinach.\u201d What do you think of that, now?\u2019\n\u2018I think it sounds \ufb01lthy,\u2019 said Edward.\n\u2018No, no, actually it would be very good\u2014but what do you\nthink of the whole thing?\u2019\nA sudden ray of light illuminated Edward\u2019s face. \u2018Do you\nthink it\u2019s a code\u2014cryptogram of some kind?\u2019 He seized it.\n\u2018Look here, Charmian, it might be, you know! No reason to\nput a cooking-recipe in a secret drawer otherwise.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018Very, very signi\ufb01cant.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nCharmian said, \u2018I know what it might be\u2014invisible ink!\nLet\u2019s heat it. Turn on the electric \ufb01re.\u2019\nEdward did so, but no signs of writing appeared under\nthe treatment.\nMiss Marple coughed. \u2018I really think, you know, that\nyou\u2019re making it rather too di\ufb03cult. The recipe is only an\nindication, so to speak. It is, I think, the letters that are\nsigni\ufb01cant.\u2019\n\u2018The letters?\u2019\n\u2018Especially,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018the signature.\u2019\nBut Edward hardly heard her. He called excitedly,\n\u2018Charmian! Come here! She\u2019s right. See\u2014the envelopes are\nold, right enough, but the letters themselves were written\nmuch later.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018They\u2019re only fake old. I bet anything old Uncle Mat faked\nthem himself\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Precisely,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018The whole thing\u2019s a sell. There never was a female\nmissionary. It must be a code.\u2019\n\u2018My dear, dear children\u2014there\u2019s really no need to make it\nall so di\ufb03cult. Your uncle was really a very simple man. He\nhad to have his little joke, that was all.\u2019\nFor the \ufb01rst time they gave her their full attention.\n\u2018Just exactly what do you mean, Miss Marple?\u2019 asked\nCharmian.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I mean, dear, that you\u2019re actually holding the money in\nyour hand this minute.\u2019\nCharmian stared down.\n\u2018The signature, dear. That gives the whole thing away.\nThe recipe is just an indication. Shorn of all the cloves and\nbrown sugar and the rest of it, what is it actually? Why,\ngammon and spinach to be sure! Gammon and spinach!\nMeaning\u2014nonsense! So it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s the letters that\nare important. And then, if you take into consideration what\nyour uncle did just before he died. He tapped his eye, you\nsaid. Well, there you are\u2014that gives you the clue, you see.\u2019\nCharmian said, \u2018Are we mad, or are you?\u2019\n\u2018Surely, my dear, you must have heard the expression\nmeaning that something is not a true picture, or has it quite\ndied out nowadays? \u201cAll my eye and Betty Martin.\u201d \u2019\nEdward gasped, his eyes falling to the letter in his hand.\n\u2018Betty Martin\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Of course, Mr Rossiter. As you have just said, there isn\u2019t\n\u2014there wasn\u2019t any such person. The letters were written by\nyour uncle, and I dare say he got a lot of fun out of writing\nthem! As you say, the writing on the envelopes is much\nolder\u2014in fact, the envelope couldn\u2019t belong to the letters,\nanyway, because the postmark of one you are holding is\neighteen \ufb01fty-one.\u2019\nShe paused. She made it very emphatic. \u2018Eighteen \ufb01fty-\none. And that explains everything, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\u2018Not to me,\u2019 said Edward.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, of course,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018I dare say it wouldn\u2019t\nto me if it weren\u2019t for my great-nephew Lionel. Such a dear\nlittle boy and a passionate stamp collector. Knows all about\nstamps. It was he who told me about the rare and expensive\nstamps and that a wonderful new \ufb01nd had come up for\nauction. And I actually remember his mentioning one stamp\n\u2014an eighteen \ufb01fty-one blue two-cent. It realized something\nlike twenty-\ufb01ve thousand dollars, I believe. Fancy! I should\nimagine that the other stamps are something also rare and\nexpensive. No doubt your uncle bought through dealers and\nwas careful to \u201ccover his tracks\u201d, as they say in detective\nstories.\u2019\nEdward groaned. He sat down and buried his face in his\nhands.\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 demanded Charmian.\n\u2018Nothing. It\u2019s only the awful thought that, but for Miss\nMarple, we might have burned these letters in a decent,\ngentlemanly way!\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018that\u2019s just what these old\ngentlemen who are fond of their jokes never realize. Uncle\nHenry, I remember, sent a favourite niece a \ufb01ve-pound note\nfor a Christmas present. He put it in a Christmas card,\ngummed the card together, and wrote on it, \u201cLove and best\nwishes. Afraid this is all I can manage this year.\u201d \u2019\n\u2018She, poor girl, was annoyed at what she thought was his\nmeanness and threw it all straight into the \ufb01re; then, of\ncourse, he had to give her another.\u2019\nEdward\u2019s feelings towards Uncle Henry had su\ufb00ered an\nabrupt and complete change.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Miss Marple,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to get a bottle of\nchampagne. We\u2019ll all drink the health of your Uncle Henry.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nTape-Measure Murder\nI\nMiss Politt took hold of the knocker and rapped politely on\nthe cottage door. After a discreet interval she knocked\nagain. The parcel under her left arm shifted a little as she\ndid so, and she readjusted it. Inside the parcel was Mrs\nSpenlow\u2019s new green winter dress, ready for \ufb01tting. From\nMiss Politt\u2019s left hand dangled a bag of black silk, containing\na tape measure, a pincushion, and a large, practical pair of\nscissors.\nMiss Politt was tall and gaunt, with a sharp nose, pursed\nlips, and meagre iron-grey hair. She hesitated before using\nthe knocker for the third time. Glancing down the street, she\nsaw a \ufb01gure rapidly approaching. Miss Hartnell, jolly,\nweather-beaten, \ufb01fty-\ufb01ve, shouted out in her usual loud\nbass voice, \u2018Good afternoon, Miss Politt!\u2019\nThe \ndressmaker \nanswered, \n\u2018Good \nafternoon, \nMiss\nHartnell.\u2019 Her voice was excessively thin and genteel in its\naccents. She had started life as a lady\u2019s maid. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019\nshe went on, \u2018but do you happen to know if by any chance\nMrs Spenlow isn\u2019t at home?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Not the least idea,\u2019 said Miss Hartnell.\n\u2018It\u2019s rather awkward, you see. I was to \ufb01t on Mrs\nSpenlow\u2019s new dress this afternoon. Three-thirty, she said.\u2019\nMiss Hartnell consulted her wrist watch. \u2018It\u2019s a little past\nthe half-hour now.\u2019\n\u2018Yes. I have knocked three times, but there doesn\u2019t seem\nto be any answer, so I was wondering if perhaps Mrs\nSpenlow might have gone out and forgotten. She doesn\u2019t\nforget appointments as a rule, and she wants the dress to\nwear the day after tomorrow.\u2019\nMiss Hartnell entered the gate and walked up the path to\njoin Miss Politt outside the door of Laburnum Cottage.\n\u2018Why doesn\u2019t Gladys answer the door?\u2019 she demanded.\n\u2018Oh, no, of course, it\u2019s Thursday\u2014Gladys\u2019s day out. I expect\nMrs Spenlow has fallen asleep. I don\u2019t expect you\u2019ve made\nenough noise with this thing.\u2019\nSeizing the knocker, she executed a deafening rat-a-tat-\ntat, and in addition thumped upon the panels of the door.\nShe also called out in a stentorian voice, \u2018What ho, within\nthere!\u2019\nThere was no response.\nMiss Politt murmured, \u2018Oh, I think Mrs Spenlow must have\nforgotten and gone out, I\u2019ll call round some other time.\u2019 She\nbegan edging away down the path.\n\u2018Nonsense,\u2019 said Miss Hartnell \ufb01rmly. \u2018She can\u2019t have\ngone out. I\u2019d have met her. I\u2019ll just take a look through the\nwindows and see if I can \ufb01nd any signs of life.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nShe laughed in her usual hearty manner, to indicate that\nit was a joke, and applied a perfunctory glance to the\nnearest window-pane\u2014perfunctory because she knew quite\nwell that the front room was seldom used, Mr and Mrs\nSpenlow preferring the small back sitting-room.\nPerfunctory as it was, though, it succeeded in its object.\nMiss Hartnell, it is true, saw no signs of life. On the contrary,\nshe saw, through the window, Mrs Spenlow lying on the\nhearthrug\u2014dead.\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Miss Hartnell, telling the story\nafterwards, \u2018I managed to keep my head. That Politt\ncreature wouldn\u2019t have had the least idea of what to do.\n\u201cGot to keep our heads,\u201d I said to her. \u201cYou stay here, and I\u2019ll\ngo for Constable Palk.\u201d She said something about not\nwanting to be left, but I paid no attention at all. One has to\nbe \ufb01rm with that sort of person. I\u2019ve always found they\nenjoy making a fuss. So I was just going o\ufb00 when, at that\nvery moment, Mr Spenlow came round the corner of the\nhouse.\u2019\nHere Miss Hartnell made a signi\ufb01cant pause. It enabled\nher audience to ask breathlessly, \u2018Tell me, how did he look?\u2019\nMiss Hartnell would then go on, \u2018Frankly, I suspected\nsomething at once! He was far too calm. He didn\u2019t seem\nsurprised in the least. And you may say what you like, it\nisn\u2019t natural for a man to hear that his wife is dead and\ndisplay no emotion whatever.\u2019\nEverybody agreed with this statement.\nThe police agreed with it, too. So suspicious did they\nconsider Mr Spenlow\u2019s detachment, that they lost no time in\nascertaining how that gentleman was situated as a result of\nhis wife\u2019s death. When they discovered that Mrs Spenlow\n\n----Page Break----\nhad been the monied partner, and that her money went to\nher husband under a will made soon after their marriage,\nthey were more suspicious than ever.\nMiss Marple, that sweet-faced\u2014and, some said, vinegar-\ntongued\u2014elderly spinster who lived in the house next to the\nrectory, was interviewed very early\u2014within half an hour of\nthe discovery of the crime. She was approached by Police\nConstable Palk, importantly thumbing a notebook. \u2018If you\ndon\u2019t mind, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ve a few questions to ask you.\u2019\nMiss Marple said, \u2018In connection with the murder of Mrs\nSpenlow?\u2019\nPalk was startled. \u2018May I ask, madam, how you got to\nknow of it?\u2019\n\u2018The \ufb01sh,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\nThe reply was perfectly intelligible to Constable Palk. He\nassumed correctly that the \ufb01shmonger\u2019s boy had brought it,\ntogether with Miss Marple\u2019s evening meal.\nMiss Marple continued gently. \u2018Lying on the \ufb02oor in the\nsitting-room, strangled\u2014possibly by a very narrow belt. But\nwhatever it was, it was taken away.\u2019\nPalk\u2019s face was wrathful. \u2018How that young Fred gets to\nknow everything\u2014\u2019\nMiss Marple cut him short adroitly. She said, \u2018There\u2019s a\npin in your tunic.\u2019\nConstable Palk looked down, startled. He said, \u2018They do\nsay, \u201cSee a pin and pick it up, all the day you\u2019ll have good\nluck.\u201d \u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I hope that will come true. Now what is it you want me\nto tell you?\u2019\nConstable Palk cleared his throat, looked important, and\nconsulted his notebook. \u2018Statement was made to me by Mr\nArthur Spenlow, husband of the deceased. Mr Spenlow says\nthat at two-thirty, as far as he can say, he was rung up by\nMiss Marple, and asked if he would come over at a quarter\npast three as she was anxious to consult him about\nsomething. Now, ma\u2019am, is that true?\u2019\n\u2018Certainly not,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018You did not ring up Mr Spenlow at two-thirty?\u2019\n\u2018Neither at two-thirty nor any other time.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Constable Palk, and sucked his moustache with\na good deal of satisfaction.\n\u2018What else did Mr Spenlow say?\u2019\n\u2018Mr Spenlow\u2019s statement was that he came over here as\nrequested, leaving his own house at ten minutes past three;\nthat on arrival here he was informed by the maid-servant\nthat Miss Marple was \u201cnot at \u2019ome\u201d.\u2019\n\u2018That part of it is true,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018He did come\nhere, but I was at a meeting at the Women\u2019s Institute.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Constable Palk again.\nMiss Marple exclaimed, \u2018Do tell me, Constable, do you\nsuspect Mr Spenlow?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not for me to say at this stage, but it looks to me as\nthough somebody, naming no names, has been trying to be\n\n----Page Break----\nartful.\u2019\nMiss Marple said thoughtfully, \u2018Mr Spenlow?\u2019\nShe liked Mr Spenlow. He was a small, spare man, sti\ufb00\nand conventional in speech, the acme of respectability. It\nseemed odd that he should have come to live in the\ncountry, he had so clearly lived in towns all his life. To Miss\nMarple he con\ufb01ded the reason. He said, \u2018I have always\nintended, ever since I was a small boy, to live in the country\nsome day and have a garden of my own. I have always been\nvery much attached to \ufb02owers. My wife, you know, kept a\n\ufb02ower shop. That\u2019s where I saw her \ufb01rst.\u2019\nA dry statement, but it opened up a vista of romance. A\nyounger, prettier Mrs Spenlow, seen against a background\nof \ufb02owers.\nMr Spenlow, however, really knew nothing about \ufb02owers.\nHe had no idea of seeds, of cuttings, of bedding out, of\nannuals or perennials. He had only a vision\u2014a vision of a\nsmall cottage garden thickly planted with sweet-smelling,\nbrightly \ncoloured \nblossoms. \nHe \nhad \nasked, \nalmost\npathetically, for instruction, and had noted down Miss\nMarple\u2019s replies to questions in a little book.\nHe was a man of quiet method. It was, perhaps, because\nof this trait, that the police were interested in him when his\nwife was found murdered. With patience and perseverance\nthey learned a good deal about the late Mrs Spenlow\u2014and\nsoon all St Mary Mead knew it, too.\nThe late Mrs Spenlow had begun life as a between-maid\nin a large house. She had left that position to marry the\nsecond gardener, and with him had started a \ufb02ower shop in\nLondon. The shop had prospered. Not so the gardener, who\nbefore long had sickened and died.\n\n----Page Break----\nHis widow carried on the shop and enlarged it in an\nambitious way. She had continued to prosper. Then she had\nsold the business at a handsome price and embarked upon\nmatrimony for the second time\u2014with Mr Spenlow, a middle-\naged jeweller who had inherited a small and struggling\nbusiness. Not long afterwards, they had sold the business\nand came down to St Mary Mead.\nMrs Spenlow was a well-to-do woman. The pro\ufb01ts from\nher \ufb02orist\u2019s establishment she had invested\u2014\u2018under spirit\nguidance\u2019, as she explained to all and sundry. The spirits\nhad advised her with unexpected acumen.\nAll her investments had prospered, some in quite a\nsensational fashion. Instead, however, of this increasing her\nbelief in spiritualism, Mrs Spenlow basely deserted mediums\nand sittings, and made a brief but wholehearted plunge into\nan obscure religion with Indian a\ufb03nities which was based on\nvarious forms of deep breathing. When, however, she\narrived at St Mary Mead, she had relapsed into a period of\northodox Church-of-England beliefs. She was a good deal at\nthe vicarage, and attended church services with assiduity.\nShe patronized the village shops, took an interest in the\nlocal happenings, and played village bridge.\nA humdrum, everyday life. And\u2014suddenly\u2014murder.\nII\nColonel Melchett, the chief constable, had summoned\nInspector Slack.\nSlack was a positive type of man. When he had made up\nhis mind, he was sure. He was quite sure now. \u2018Husband did\nit, sir,\u2019 he said.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You think so?\u2019\n\u2018Quite sure of it. You\u2019ve only got to look at him. Guilty as\nhell. Never showed a sign of grief or emotion. He came back\nto the house knowing she was dead.\u2019\n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t he at least have tried to act the part of the\ndistracted husband?\u2019\n\u2018Not him, sir. Too pleased with himself. Some gentlemen\ncan\u2019t act. Too sti\ufb00.\u2019\n\u2018Any other woman in his life?\u2019 Colonel Melchett asked.\n\u2018Haven\u2019t been able to \ufb01nd any trace of one. Of course,\nhe\u2019s the artful kind. He\u2019d cover his tracks. As I see it, he was\njust fed up with his wife. She\u2019d got the money, and I should\nsay was a trying woman to live with\u2014always taking up with\nsome \u201cism\u201d or other. He cold-bloodedly decided to do away\nwith her and live comfortably on his own.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, that could be the case, I suppose.\u2019\n\u2018Depend upon it, that was it. Made his plans careful.\nPretended to get a phone call\u2014\u2019\nMelchett interrupted him. \u2018No call been traced?\u2019\n\u2018No, sir. That means either that he lied, or that the call\nwas put through from a public telephone booth. The only\ntwo public phones in the village are at the station and the\npost o\ufb03ce. Post o\ufb03ce it certainly wasn\u2019t. Mrs Blade sees\neveryone who comes in. Station it might be. Train arrives at\ntwo twenty-seven and there\u2019s a bit of a bustle then. But the\nmain thing is he says it was Miss Marple who called him up,\nand that certainly isn\u2019t true. The call didn\u2019t come from her\nhouse, and she herself was away at the Institute.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You\u2019re not overlooking the possibility that the husband\nwas deliberately got out of the way\u2014by someone who\nwanted to murder Mrs Spenlow?\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re thinking of young Ted Gerard, aren\u2019t you, sir? I\u2019ve\nbeen working on him\u2014what we\u2019re up against there is lack of\nmotive. He doesn\u2019t stand to gain anything.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s an undesirable character, though. Quite a pretty\nlittle spot of embezzlement to his credit.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not saying he isn\u2019t a wrong \u2019un. Still, he did go to his\nboss and own up to that embezzlement. And his employers\nweren\u2019t wise to it.\u2019\n\u2018An Oxford Grouper,\u2019 said Melchett.\n\u2018Yes, sir. Became a convert and went o\ufb00 to do the\nstraight thing and own up to having pinched money. I\u2019m not\nsaying, mind you, that it mayn\u2019t have been astuteness. He\nmay have thought he was suspected and decided to gamble\non honest repentance.\u2019\n\u2018You have a sceptical mind, Slack,\u2019 said Colonel Melchett.\n\u2018By the way, have you talked to Miss Marple at all?\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s she got to do with it, sir?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, nothing. But she hears things, you know. Why don\u2019t\nyou go and have a chat with her? She\u2019s a very sharp old\nlady.\u2019\nSlack changed the subject. \u2018One thing I\u2019ve been meaning\nto ask you, sir. That domestic-service job where the\ndeceased started her career\u2014Sir Robert Abercrombie\u2019s\nplace. That\u2019s where that jewel robbery was\u2014emeralds\u2014\nworth a packet. Never got them. I\u2019ve been looking it up\u2014\n\n----Page Break----\nmust have happened when the Spenlow woman was there,\nthough she\u2019d have been quite a girl at the time. Don\u2019t think\nshe was mixed up in it, do you, sir? Spenlow, you know, was\none of those little tuppenny-ha\u2019penny jewellers\u2014just the\nchap for a fence.\u2019\nMelchett shook his head. \u2018Don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in\nthat. She didn\u2019t even know Spenlow at the time. I remember\nthe case. Opinion in police circles was that a son of the\nhouse was mixed up in it\u2014Jim Abercrombie\u2014awful young\nwaster. Had a pile of debts, and just after the robbery they\nwere all paid o\ufb00\u2014some rich woman, so they said, but I don\u2019t\nknow\u2014Old Abercrombie hedged a bit about the case\u2014tried\nto call the police o\ufb00.\u2019\n\u2018It was just an idea, sir,\u2019 said Slack.\nIII\nMiss Marple received Inspector Slack with grati\ufb01cation,\nespecially when she heard that he had been sent by Colonel\nMelchett.\n\u2018Now, really, that is very kind of Colonel Melchett. I didn\u2019t\nknow he remembered me.\u2019\n\u2018He remembers you, all right. Told me that what you\ndidn\u2019t know of what goes on in St Mary Mead isn\u2019t worth\nknowing.\u2019\n\u2018Too kind of him, but really I don\u2019t know anything at all.\nAbout this murder, I mean.\u2019\n\u2018You know what the talk about it is.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh, of course\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t do, would it, to repeat just\nidle talk?\u2019\nSlack said, with an attempt at geniality, \u2018This isn\u2019t an\no\ufb03cial conversation, you know. It\u2019s in con\ufb01dence, so to\nspeak.\u2019\n\u2018You mean you really want to know what people are\nsaying? Whether there\u2019s any truth in it or not?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the idea.\u2019\n\u2018Well, of course, there\u2019s been a great deal of talk and\nspeculation. And there are really two distinct camps, if you\nunderstand me. To begin with, there are the people who\nthink that the husband did it. A husband or a wife is, in a\nway, the natural person to suspect, don\u2019t you think so?\u2019\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said the inspector cautiously.\n\u2018Such close quarters, you know. Then, so often, the\nmoney angle. I hear that it was Mrs Spenlow who had the\nmoney, and therefore Mr Spenlow does bene\ufb01t by her\ndeath. In this wicked world I\u2019m afraid the most uncharitable\nassumptions are often justi\ufb01ed.\u2019\n\u2018He comes into a tidy sum, all right.\u2019\n\u2018Just so. It would seem quite plausible, wouldn\u2019t it, for\nhim to strangle her, leave the house by the back, come\nacross the \ufb01elds to my house, ask for me and pretend he\u2019d\nhad a telephone call from me, then go back and \ufb01nd his wife\nmurdered in his absence\u2014hoping, of course, that the crime\nwould be put down to some tramp or burglar.\u2019\nThe inspector nodded. \u2018What with the money angle\u2014and\nif they\u2019d been on bad terms lately\u2014\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nBut Miss Marple interrupted him. \u2018Oh, but they hadn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018You know that for a fact?\u2019\n\u2018Everyone would have known if they\u2019d quarrelled! The\nmaid, Gladys Brent\u2014she\u2019d have soon spread it round the\nvillage.\u2019\nThe inspector said feebly, \u2018She mightn\u2019t have known\u2014\u2019\nand received a pitying smile in reply.\nMiss Marple went on. \u2018And then there\u2019s the other school\nof thought. Ted Gerard. A good-looking young man. I\u2019m\nafraid, you know, that good looks are inclined to in\ufb02uence\none more than they should. Our last curate but one\u2014quite a\nmagical e\ufb00ect! All the girls came to church\u2014evening service\nas well as morning. And many older women became\nunusually active in parish work\u2014and the slippers and scarfs\nthat were made for him! Quite embarrassing for the poor\nyoung man.\n\u2018But let me see, where was I? Oh, yes, this young man,\nTed Gerard. Of course, there has been talk about him. He\u2019s\ncome down to see her so often. Though Mrs Spenlow told\nme herself that he was a member of what I think they call\nthe Oxford Group. A religious movement. They are quite\nsincere and very earnest, I believe, and Mrs Spenlow was\nimpressed by it all.\u2019\nMiss Marple took a breath and went on. \u2018And I\u2019m sure\nthere was no reason to believe that there was anything\nmore in it than that, but you know what people are. Quite a\nlot of people are convinced that Mrs Spenlow was infatuated\nwith the young man, and that she\u2019d lent him quite a lot of\nmoney. And it\u2019s perfectly true that he was actually seen at\nthe station that day. In the train\u2014the two twenty-seven\ndown train. But of course it would be quite easy, wouldn\u2019t it,\n\n----Page Break----\nto slip out of the other side of the train and go through the\ncutting and over the fence and round by the hedge and\nnever come out of the station entrance at all. So that he\nneed not have been seen going to the cottage. And, of\ncourse, people do think that what Mrs Spenlow was wearing\nwas rather peculiar.\u2019\n\u2018Peculiar?\u2019\n\u2018A kimono. Not a dress.\u2019 Miss Marple blushed. \u2018That sort\nof thing, you know, is, perhaps, rather suggestive to some\npeople.\u2019\n\u2018You think it was suggestive?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, I don\u2019t think so, I think it was perfectly natural.\u2019\n\u2018You think it was natural?\u2019\n\u2018Under the circumstances, yes.\u2019 Miss Marple\u2019s glance was\ncool and re\ufb02ective.\nInspector Slack said, \u2018It might give us another motive for\nthe husband. Jealousy.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, Mr Spenlow would never be jealous. He\u2019s not the\nsort of man who notices things. If his wife had gone away\nand left a note on the pincushion, it would be the \ufb01rst he\u2019d\nknow of anything of that kind.\u2019\nInspector Slack was puzzled by the intent way she was\nlooking at him. He had an idea that all her conversation was\nintended to hint at something he didn\u2019t understand. She\nsaid now, with some emphasis, \u2018Didn\u2019t you \ufb01nd any clues,\nInspector\u2014on the spot?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018People don\u2019t leave \ufb01ngerprints and cigarette ash\nnowadays, Miss Marple.\u2019\n\u2018But this, I think,\u2019 she suggested, \u2018was an old-fashioned\ncrime\u2014\u2019\nSlack said sharply, \u2018Now what do you mean by that?\u2019\nMiss Marple remarked slowly, \u2018I think, you know, that\nConstable Palk could help you. He was the \ufb01rst person on\nthe\u2014on the \u201cscene of the crime\u201d, as they say.\u2019\nIV\nMr Spenlow was sitting in a deck chair. He looked\nbewildered. He said, in his thin, precise voice, \u2018I may, of\ncourse, be imagining what occurred. My hearing is not as\ngood as it was. But I distinctly think I heard a small boy call\nafter me, \u201cYah, who\u2019s a Crippen?\u201d It\u2014it conveyed the\nimpression to me that he was of the opinion that I had\u2014had\nkilled my dear wife.\u2019\nMiss Marple, gently snipping o\ufb00 a dead rose head, said,\n\u2018That was the impression he meant to convey, no doubt.\u2019\n\u2018But what could possibly have put such an idea into a\nchild\u2019s head?\u2019\nMiss Marple coughed. \u2018Listening, no doubt, to the\nopinions of his elders.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2014you really mean that other people think that, also?\u2019\n\u2018Quite half the people in St Mary Mead.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018But\u2014my dear lady\u2014what can possibly have given rise to\nsuch an idea? I was sincerely attached to my wife. She did\nnot, alas, take to living in the country as much as I had\nhoped she would do, but perfect agreement on every\nsubject is an impossible idea. I assure you I feel her loss\nvery keenly.\u2019\n\u2018Probably. But if you will excuse my saying so, you don\u2019t\nsound as though you do.\u2019\nMr Spenlow drew his meagre frame up to its full height.\n\u2018My dear lady, many years ago I read of a certain Chinese\nphilosopher who, when his dearly loved wife was taken from\nhim, continued calmly to beat a gong in the street\u2014a\ncustomary Chinese pastime, I presume\u2014exactly as usual.\nThe people of the city were much impressed by his\nfortitude.\u2019\n\u2018But,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018the people of St Mary Mead react\nrather di\ufb00erently. Chinese philosophy does not appeal to\nthem.\u2019\n\u2018But you understand?\u2019\nMiss Marple nodded. \u2018My Uncle Henry,\u2019 she explained,\n\u2018was a man of unusual self-control. His motto was \u201cNever\ndisplay emotion\u201d. He, too, was very fond of \ufb02owers.\u2019\n\u2018I was thinking,\u2019 said Mr Spenlow with something like\neagerness, \u2018that I might, perhaps, have a pergola on the\nwest side of the cottage. Pink roses and, perhaps, wisteria.\nAnd there is a white starry \ufb02ower, whose name for the\nmoment escapes me\u2014\u2019\nIn the tone in which she spoke to her grandnephew, aged\nthree, Miss Marple said, \u2018I have a very nice catalogue here,\n\n----Page Break----\nwith pictures. Perhaps you would like to look through it\u2014I\nhave to go up to the village.\u2019\nLeaving Mr Spenlow sitting happily in the garden with his\ncatalogue, Miss Marple went up to her room, hastily rolled\nup a dress in a piece of brown paper, and, leaving the\nhouse, walked briskly up to the post o\ufb03ce. Miss Politt, the\ndressmaker, lived in the rooms over the post o\ufb03ce.\nBut Miss Marple did not at once go through the door and\nup the stairs. It was just two-thirty, and, a minute late, the\nMuch Benham bus drew up outside the post o\ufb03ce door. It\nwas one of the events of the day in St Mary Mead. The\npostmistress hurried out with parcels, parcels connected\nwith the shop side of her business, for the post o\ufb03ce also\ndealt in sweets, cheap books, and children\u2019s toys.\nFor some four minutes Miss Marple was alone in the post\no\ufb03ce.\nNot till the postmistress returned to her post did Miss\nMarple go upstairs and explain to Miss Politt that she\nwanted her old grey crepe altered and made more\nfashionable if that were possible. Miss Politt promised to see\nwhat she could do.\nV\nThe chief constable was rather astonished when Miss\nMarple\u2019s name was brought to him. She came in with many\napologies. \u2018So sorry\u2014so very sorry to disturb you. You are so\nbusy, I know, but then you have always been so very kind,\nColonel Melchett, and I felt I would rather come to you\ninstead of Inspector Slack. For one thing, you know, I should\nhate Constable Palk to get into any trouble. Strictly\n\n----Page Break----\nspeaking, I suppose he shouldn\u2019t have touched anything at\nall.\u2019\nColonel Melchett was slightly bewildered. He said, \u2018Palk?\nThat\u2019s the St Mary Mead constable, isn\u2019t it? What has he\nbeen doing?\u2019\n\u2018He picked up a pin, you know. It was in his tunic. And it\noccurred to me at the time that it was quite probable he had\nactually picked it up in Mrs Spenlow\u2019s house.\u2019\n\u2018Quite, quite. But after all, you know, what\u2019s a pin?\nMatter of fact he did pick the pin up just by Mrs Spenlow\u2019s\nbody. Came and told Slack about it yesterday\u2014you put him\nup to that, I gather? Oughtn\u2019t to have touched anything, of\ncourse, but as I said, what\u2019s a pin? It was only a common\npin. Sort of thing any woman might use.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no, Colonel Melchett, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. To\na man\u2019s eye, perhaps, it looked like an ordinary pin, but it\nwasn\u2019t. It was a special pin, a very thin pin, the kind you buy\nby the box, the kind used mostly by dressmakers.\u2019\nMelchett stared at her, a faint light of comprehension\nbreaking in on him. Miss Marple nodded her head several\ntimes, eagerly.\n\u2018Yes, of course. It seems to me so obvious. She was in her\nkimono because she was going to try on her new dress, and\nshe went into the front room, and Miss Politt just said\nsomething about measurements and put the tape measure\nround her neck\u2014and then all she\u2019d have to do was to cross\nit and pull\u2014quite easy, so I\u2019ve heard. And then, of course,\nshe\u2019d go outside and pull the door to and stand there\nknocking as though she\u2019d just arrived. But the pin shows\nshe\u2019d already been in the house.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018And it was Miss Politt who telephoned to Spenlow?\u2019\n\u2018Yes. From the post o\ufb03ce at two-thirty\u2014just when the bus\ncomes and the post o\ufb03ce would be empty.\u2019\nColonel Melchett said, \u2018But my dear Miss Marple, why? In\nheaven\u2019s name, why? You can\u2019t have a murder without a\nmotive.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I think, you know, Colonel Melchett, from all I\u2019ve\nheard, that the crime dates from a long time back. It\nreminds me, you know, of my two cousins, Antony and\nGordon. Whatever Antony did always went right for him, and\nwith poor Gordon it was just the other way about. Race\nhorses went lame, and stocks went down, and property\ndepreciated. As I see it, the two women were in it together.\u2019\n\u2018In what?\u2019\n\u2018The robbery. Long ago. Very valuable emeralds, so I\u2019ve\nheard. The lady\u2019s maid and the tweeny. Because one thing\nhasn\u2019t been explained\u2014how, when the tweeny married the\ngardener, did they have enough money to set up a \ufb02ower\nshop?\n\u2018The answer is, it was her share of the\u2014the swag, I think\nis the right expression. Everything she did turned out well.\nMoney made money. But the other one, the lady\u2019s maid,\nmust have been unlucky. She came down to being just a\nvillage dressmaker. Then they met again. Quite all right at\n\ufb01rst, I expect, until Mr Ted Gerard came on the scene.\n\u2018Mrs Spenlow, you see, was already su\ufb00ering from\nconscience, and was inclined to be emotionally religious.\nThis young man no doubt urged her to \u201cface up\u201d and to\n\u201ccome clean\u201d and I dare say she was strung up to do it. But\nMiss Politt didn\u2019t see it that way. All she saw was that she\n\n----Page Break----\nmight go to prison for a robbery she had committed years\nago. So she made up her mind to put a stop to it all. I\u2019m\nafraid, you know, that she was always rather a wicked\nwoman. I don\u2019t believe she\u2019d have turned a hair if that nice,\nstupid Mr Spenlow had been hanged.\u2019\nColonel Melchett said slowly, \u2018We can\u2014er\u2014verify your\ntheory\u2014up to a point. The identity of the Politt woman with\nthe lady\u2019s maid at the Abercrombies\u2019, but\u2014\u2019\nMiss Marple reassured him. \u2018It will be all quite easy. She\u2019s\nthe kind of woman who will break down at once when she\u2019s\ntaxed with the truth. And then, you see, I\u2019ve got her tape\nmeasure. I\u2014er\u2014abstracted it yesterday when I was trying\non. When she misses it and thinks the police have got it\u2014\nwell, she\u2019s quite an ignorant woman and she\u2019ll think it will\nprove the case against her in some way.\u2019\nShe smiled at him encouragingly. \u2018You\u2019ll have no trouble,\nI can assure you.\u2019 It was the tone in which his favourite aunt\nhad once assured him that he could not fail to pass his\nentrance examination into Sandhurst.\nAnd he had passed.\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Case of the Caretaker\nI\n\u2018Well,\u2019 demanded Doctor Haydock of his patient. \u2018And how\ngoes it today?\u2019\nMiss Marple smiled at him wanly from pillows.\n\u2018I suppose, really, that I\u2019m better,\u2019 she admitted, \u2018but I\nfeel so terribly depressed. I can\u2019t help feeling how much\nbetter it would have been if I had died. After all, I\u2019m an old\nwoman. Nobody wants me or cares about me.\u2019\nDoctor Haydock interrupted with his usual brusqueness.\n\u2018Yes, yes, typical after-reaction of this type of \ufb02u. What you\nneed is something to take you out of yourself. A mental\ntonic.\u2019\nMiss Marple sighed and shook her head.\n\u2018And what\u2019s more,\u2019 continued Doctor Haydock, \u2018I\u2019ve\nbrought my medicine with me!\u2019\nHe tossed a long envelope on to the bed.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Just the thing for you. The kind of puzzle that is right up\nyour street.\u2019\n\u2018A puzzle?\u2019 Miss Marple looked interested.\n\u2018Literary e\ufb00ort of mine,\u2019 said the doctor, blushing a little.\n\u2018Tried to make a regular story of it. \u201cHe said,\u201d \u201cshe said,\u201d\n\u201cthe girl thought,\u201d etc. Facts of the story are true.\u2019\n\u2018But why a puzzle?\u2019 asked Miss Marple.\nDoctor Haydock grinned. \u2018Because the interpretation is\nup to you. I want to see if you\u2019re as clever as you always\nmake out.\u2019\nWith that Parthian shot he departed.\nMiss Marple picked up the manuscript and began to read.\n\u2018And where is the bride?\u2019 asked Miss Harmon genially.\nThe village was all agog to see the rich and\nbeautiful young wife that Harry Laxton had brought\nback from abroad. There was a general indulgent\nfeeling that Harry\u2014wicked young scapegrace\u2014had\nhad all the luck. Everyone had always felt indulgent\ntowards Harry. Even the owners of windows that had\nsu\ufb00ered from his indiscriminate use of a catapult had\nfound their indignation dissipated by young Harry\u2019s\nabject expression of regret. He had broken windows,\nrobbed orchards, poached rabbits, and later had run\ninto debt, got entangled with the local tobacconist\u2019s\ndaughter\u2014been disentangled and sent o\ufb00 to Africa\u2014\nand the village as represented by various ageing\nspinsters had murmured indulgently. \u2018Ah, well! Wild\noats! He\u2019ll settle down!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nAnd now, sure enough, the prodigal had returned\u2014\nnot in a\ufb04iction, but in triumph. Harry Laxton had\n\u2018made good\u2019 as the saying goes. He had pulled\nhimself together, worked hard, and had \ufb01nally met\nand successfully wooed a young Anglo-French girl who\nwas the possessor of a considerable fortune.\nHarry might have lived in London, or purchased an\nestate in some fashionable hunting county, but he\npreferred to come back to the part of the world that\nwas home to him. And there, in the most romantic\nway, he purchased the derelict estate in the dower\nhouse of which he had passed his childhood.\nKingsdean House had been unoccupied for nearly\nseventy years. It had gradually fallen into decay and\nabandon. An elderly caretaker and his wife lived in the\none \nhabitable \ncorner \nof \nit. \nIt \nwas \na \nvast,\nunprepossessing grandiose mansion, the gardens\novergrown with rank vegetation and the trees\nhemming it in like some gloomy enchanter\u2019s den.\nThe dower house was a pleasant, unpretentious\nhouse and had been let for a long term of years to\nMajor Laxton, Harry\u2019s father. As a boy, Harry had\nroamed over the Kingsdean estate and knew every\ninch of the tangled woods, and the old house itself\nhad always fascinated him.\nMajor Laxton had died some years ago, so it might\nhave been thought that Harry would have had no ties\nto bring him back\u2014nevertheless it was to the home of\nhis boyhood that Harry brought his bride. The ruined\nold Kingsdean House was pulled down. An army of\nbuilders and contractors swooped down upon the\nplace, and in almost a miraculously short space of\n\n----Page Break----\ntime\u2014so marvellously does wealth tell\u2014the new\nhouse rose white and gleaming among the trees.\nNext came a posse of gardeners and after them a\nprocession of furniture vans.\nThe house was ready. Servants arrived. Lastly, a\ncostly limousine deposited Harry and Mrs Harry at the\nfront door.\nThe village rushed to call, and Mrs Price, who\nowned the largest house, and who considered herself\nto lead society in the place, sent out cards of\ninvitation for a party \u2018to meet the bride\u2019.\nIt was a great event. Several ladies had new frocks\nfor the occasion. Everyone was excited, curious,\nanxious to see this fabulous creature. They said it was\nall so like a fairy story!\nMiss Harmon, weather-beaten, hearty spinster,\nthrew out her question as she squeezed her way\nthrough the crowded drawing-room door. Little Miss\nBrent, a thin, acidulated spinster, \ufb02uttered out\ninformation.\n\u2018Oh, \nmy \ndear, \nquite \ncharming. \nSuch \npretty\nmanners. And quite young. Really, you know, it makes\none feel quite envious to see someone who has\neverything like that. Good looks and money and\nbreeding\u2014most distinguished, nothing in the least\ncommon about her\u2014and dear Harry so devoted!\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Miss Harmon, \u2018it\u2019s early days yet!\u2019\nMiss Brent\u2019s thin nose quivered appreciatively. \u2018Oh,\nmy dear, do you really think\u2014\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018We all know what Harry is,\u2019 said Miss Harmon.\n\u2018We know what he was! But I expect now\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Miss Harmon, \u2018men are always the same.\nOnce a gay deceiver, always a gay deceiver. I know\nthem.\u2019\n\u2018Dear, dear. Poor young thing.\u2019 Miss Brent looked\nmuch happier. \u2018Yes, I expect she\u2019ll have trouble with\nhim. Someone ought really to warn her. I wonder if\nshe\u2019s heard anything of the old story?\u2019\n\u2018It seems so very unfair,\u2019 said Miss Brent, \u2018that she\nshould know nothing. So awkward. Especially with\nonly the one chemist\u2019s shop in the village.\u2019\nFor the erstwhile tobacconist\u2019s daughter was now\nmarried to Mr Edge, the chemist.\n\u2018It would be so much nicer,\u2019 said Miss Brent, \u2018if Mrs\nLaxton were to deal with Boots in Much Benham.\u2019\n\u2018I dare say,\u2019 said Miss Harmon, \u2018that Harry Laxton\nwill suggest that himself.\u2019\nAnd again a signi\ufb01cant look passed between them.\n\u2018But I certainly think,\u2019 said Miss Harmon, \u2018that she\nought to know.\u2019\nII\n\u2018Beasts!\u2019 said Clarice Vane indignantly to her uncle,\nDoctor Haydock. \u2018Absolute beasts some people are.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nHe looked at her curiously.\nShe was a tall, dark girl, handsome, warm-hearted\nand impulsive. Her big brown eyes were alight now\nwith indignation as she said, \u2018All these cats\u2014saying\nthings\u2014hinting things.\u2019\n\u2018About Harry Laxton?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, about his a\ufb00air with the tobacconist\u2019s\ndaughter.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, that!\u2019 The doctor shrugged his shoulders. \u2018A\ngreat many young men have a\ufb00airs of that kind.\u2019\n\u2018Of course they do. And it\u2019s all over. So why harp on\nit? And bring it up years after? It\u2019s like ghouls feasting\non dead bodies.\u2019\n\u2018I dare say, my dear, it does seem like that to you.\nBut you see, they have very little to talk about down\nhere, and so I\u2019m afraid they do tend to dwell upon\npast scandals. But I\u2019m curious to know why it upsets\nyou so much?\u2019\nClarice Vane bit her lip and \ufb02ushed. She said, in a\ncuriously mu\ufb04ed voice. \u2018They\u2014they look so happy.\nThe Laxtons, I mean. They\u2019re young and in love, and\nit\u2019s all so lovely for them. I hate to think of it being\nspoiled by whispers and hints and innuendoes and\ngeneral beastliness.\u2019\n\u2018H\u2019m. I see.\u2019\nClarice went on. \u2018He was talking to me just now.\nHe\u2019s so happy and eager and excited and\u2014yes,\nthrilled\u2014at having got his heart\u2019s desire and rebuilt\n\n----Page Break----\nKingsdean. He\u2019s like a child about it all. And she\u2014well,\nI don\u2019t suppose anything has ever gone wrong in her\nwhole life. She\u2019s always had everything. You\u2019ve seen\nher. What did you think of her?\u2019\nThe doctor did not answer at once. For other\npeople, Louise Laxton might be an object of envy. A\nspoiled darling of fortune. To him she had brought\nonly the refrain of a popular song heard many years\nago, Poor little rich girl\u2014\nA small, delicate \ufb01gure, with \ufb02axen hair curled\nrather sti\ufb04y round her face and big, wistful blue eyes.\nLouise was drooping a little. The long stream of\ncongratulations had tired her. She was hoping it might\nsoon be time to go. Perhaps, even now, Harry might\nsay so. She looked at him sideways. So tall and broad-\nshouldered with his eager pleasure in this horrible,\ndull party.\nPoor little rich girl\u2014\nIII\n\u2018Ooph!\u2019 It was a sigh of relief.\nHarry turned to look at his wife amusedly. They\nwere driving away from the party.\nShe said, \u2018Darling, what a frightful party!\u2019\nHarry laughed. \u2018Yes, pretty terrible. Never mind, my\nsweet. It had to be done, you know. All these old\npussies knew me when I lived here as a boy. They\u2019d\n\n----Page Break----\nhave been terribly disappointed not to have got a look\nat you close up.\u2019\nLouise made a grimace. She said, \u2018Shall we have to\nsee a lot of them?\u2019\n\u2018What? \nOh, \nno. \nThey\u2019ll \ncome \nand \nmake\nceremonious calls with card cases, and you\u2019ll return\nthe calls and then you needn\u2019t bother any more. You\ncan have your own friends down or whatever you like.\u2019\nLouise said, after a minute or two, \u2018Isn\u2019t there\nanyone amusing living down here?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, yes. There\u2019s the County, you know. Though\nyou may \ufb01nd them a bit dull, too. Mostly interested in\nbulbs and dogs and horses. You\u2019ll ride, of course. You\u2019ll\nenjoy that. There\u2019s a horse over at Eglinton I\u2019d like\nyou to see. A beautiful animal, perfectly trained, no\nvice in him but plenty of spirit.\u2019\nThe car slowed down to take the turn into the gates\nof Kingsdean. Harry wrenched the wheel and swore as\na grotesque \ufb01gure sprang up in the middle of the road\nand he only just managed to avoid it. It stood there,\nshaking a \ufb01st and shouting after them.\nLouise clutched his arm. \u2018Who\u2019s that\u2014that horrible\nold woman?\u2019\nHarry\u2019s brow was black. \u2018That\u2019s old Murgatroyd. She\nand her husband were caretakers in the old house.\nThey were there for nearly thirty years.\u2019\n\u2018Why does she shake her \ufb01st at you?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nHarry\u2019s face got red. \u2018She\u2014well, she resented the\nhouse being pulled down. And she got the sack, of\ncourse. Her husband\u2019s been dead two years. They say\nshe got a bit queer after he died.\u2019\n\u2018Is she\u2014she isn\u2019t\u2014starving?\u2019\nLouise\u2019s \nideas \nwere \nvague \nand \nsomewhat\nmelodramatic. Riches prevented you coming into\ncontact with reality.\nHarry was outraged. \u2018Good Lord, Louise, what an\nidea! I pensioned her o\ufb00, of course\u2014and handsomely,\ntoo! Found her a new cottage and everything.\u2019\nLouise asked, bewildered, \u2018Then why does she\nmind?\u2019\nHarry was frowning, his brows drawn together. \u2018Oh,\nhow should I know? Craziness! She loved the house.\u2019\n\u2018But it was a ruin, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\u2018Of course it was\u2014crumbling to pieces\u2014roof\nleaking\u2014more or less unsafe. All the same I suppose it\nmeant something to her. She\u2019d been there a long\ntime. Oh, I don\u2019t know! The old devil\u2019s cracked, I\nthink.\u2019\nLouise said uneasily, \u2018She\u2014I think she cursed us.\nOh, Harry, I wish she hadn\u2019t.\u2019\nIV\nIt seemed to Louise that her new home was tainted\nand poisoned by the malevolent \ufb01gure of one crazy\n\n----Page Break----\nold woman. When she went out in the car, when she\nrode, when she walked out with the dogs, there was\nalways the same \ufb01gure waiting. Crouched down on\nherself, a battered hat over wisps of iron-grey hair,\nand the slow muttering of imprecations.\nLouise came to believe that Harry was right\u2014the\nold woman was mad. Nevertheless that did not make\nthings easier. Mrs Murgatroyd never actually came to\nthe house, nor did she use de\ufb01nite threats, nor o\ufb00er\nviolence. Her squatting \ufb01gure remained always just\noutside the gates. To appeal to the police would have\nbeen useless and, in any case, Harry Laxton was\naverse to that course of action. It would, he said,\narouse local sympathy for the old brute. He took the\nmatter more easily than Louise did.\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, darling. She\u2019ll get tired of this\nsilly cursing business. Probably she\u2019s only trying it on.\u2019\n\u2018She isn\u2019t, Harry. She\u2014she hates us! I can feel it.\nShe\u2014she\u2019s ill-wishing us.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s not a witch, darling, although she may look\nlike one! Don\u2019t be morbid about it all.\u2019\nLouise was silent. Now that the \ufb01rst excitement of\nsettling in was over, she felt curiously lonely and at a\nloose end. She had been used to life in London and\nthe Riviera. She had no knowledge of or taste for\nEnglish country life. She was ignorant of gardening,\nexcept for the \ufb01nal act of \u2018doing the \ufb02owers\u2019. She did\nnot really care for dogs. She was bored by such\nneighbours as she met. She enjoyed riding best,\nsometimes with Harry, sometimes, when he was busy\nabout the estate, by herself. She hacked through the\n\n----Page Break----\nwoods and lanes, enjoying the easy paces of the\nbeautiful horse that Harry had bought for her. Yet\neven Prince Hal, most sensitive of chestnut steeds,\nwas wont to shy and snort as he carried his mistress\npast the huddled \ufb01gure of a malevolent old woman.\nOne day Louise took her courage in both hands.\nShe was out walking. She had passed Mrs Murgatroyd,\npretending not to notice her, but suddenly she\nswerved back and went right up to her. She said, a\nlittle breathlessly, \u2018What is it? What\u2019s the matter?\nWhat do you want?\u2019\nThe old woman blinked at her. She had a cunning,\ndark gypsy face, with wisps of iron-grey hair, and\nbleared, suspicious eyes. Louise wondered if she\ndrank.\nShe spoke in a whining and yet threatening voice.\n\u2018What do I want, you ask? What, indeed! That which\nhas been took away from me. Who turned me out of\nKingsdean House? I\u2019d lived there, girl and woman, for\nnear on forty years. It was a black deed to turn me out\nand it\u2019s black bad luck it\u2019ll bring to you and him!\u2019\nLouise said, \u2018You\u2019ve got a very nice cottage and\u2014\u2019\nShe broke o\ufb00. The old woman\u2019s arms \ufb02ew up. She\nscreamed, \u2018What\u2019s the good of that to me? It\u2019s my\nown place I want and my own \ufb01re as I sat beside all\nthem years. And as for you and him, I\u2019m telling you\nthere will be no happiness for you in your new \ufb01ne\nhouse. It\u2019s the black sorrow will be upon you! Sorrow\nand death and my curse. May your fair face rot.\u2019\nLouise turned away and broke into a little stumbling\nrun. She thought, I must get away from here! We must\n\n----Page Break----\nsell the house! We must go away.\nAt the moment, such a solution seemed easy to\nher. But Harry\u2019s utter incomprehension took her back.\nHe exclaimed, \u2018Leave here? Sell the house? Because\nof a crazy old woman\u2019s threats? You must be mad.\u2019\n\u2018No, I\u2019m not. But she\u2014she frightens me, I know\nsomething will happen.\u2019\nHarry Laxton said grimly, \u2018Leave Mrs Murgatroyd to\nme. I\u2019ll settle her!\u2019\nV\nA friendship had sprung up between Clarice Vane and\nyoung Mrs Laxton. The two girls were much of an age,\nthough dissimilar both in character and in tastes. In\nClarice\u2019s company, Louise found reassurance. Clarice\nwas so self-reliant, so sure of herself. Louise\nmentioned the matter of Mrs Murgatroyd and her\nthreats, but Clarice seemed to regard the matter as\nmore annoying than frightening.\n\u2018It\u2019s so stupid, that sort of thing,\u2019 she said. \u2018And\nreally very annoying for you.\u2019\n\u2018You know, Clarice, I\u2014I feel quite frightened\nsometimes. My heart gives the most awful jumps.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense, you mustn\u2019t let a silly thing like that get\nyou down. She\u2019ll soon tire of it.\u2019\nShe was silent for a minute or two. Clarice said,\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nLouise paused for a minute, then her answer came\nwith a rush. \u2018I hate this place! I hate being here. The\nwoods and this house, and the awful silence at night,\nand the queer noise owls make. Oh, and the people\nand everything.\u2019\n\u2018The people. What people?\u2019\n\u2018The people in the village. Those prying, gossiping\nold maids.\u2019\nClarice said sharply, \u2018What have they been saying?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know. Nothing particular. But they\u2019ve got\nnasty minds. When you\u2019ve talked to them you feel you\nwouldn\u2019t trust anybody\u2014not anybody at all.\u2019\nClarice said harshly, \u2018Forget them. They\u2019ve nothing\nto do but gossip. And most of the muck they talk they\njust invent.\u2019\nLouise said, \u2018I wish we\u2019d never come here. But\nHarry adores it so.\u2019 Her voice softened.\nClarice thought, How she adores him. She said\nabruptly, \u2018I must go now.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll send you back in the car. Come again soon.\u2019\nClarice nodded. Louise felt comforted by her new\nfriend\u2019s visit. Harry was pleased to \ufb01nd her more\ncheerful and from then on urged her to have Clarice\noften to the house.\nThen one day he said, \u2018Good news for you, darling.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, what?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019ve \ufb01xed the Murgatroyd. She\u2019s got a son in\nAmerica, you know. Well, I\u2019ve arranged for her to go\nout and join him. I\u2019ll pay her passage.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, Harry, how wonderful. I believe I might get to\nlike Kingsdean after all.\u2019\n\u2018Get to like it? Why, it\u2019s the most wonderful place in\nthe world!\u2019\nLouise gave a little shiver. She could not rid herself\nof her superstitious fear so easily.\nVI\nIf the ladies of St Mary Mead had hoped for the\npleasure of imparting information about her husband\u2019s\npast to the bride, this pleasure was denied them by\nHarry Laxton\u2019s own prompt action.\nMiss Harmon and Clarice Vane were both in Mr\nEdge\u2019s shop, the one buying mothballs and the other\na packet of boracic, when Harry Laxton and his wife\ncame in.\nAfter greeting the two ladies, Harry turned to the\ncounter and was just demanding a toothbrush when\nhe stopped in mid-speech and exclaimed heartily,\n\u2018Well, well, just see who\u2019s here! Bella, I do declare.\u2019\nMrs Edge, who had hurried out from the back\nparlour to attend to the congestion of business,\nbeamed back cheerfully at him, showing her big white\nteeth. She had been a dark, handsome girl and was\nstill a reasonably handsome woman, though she had\n\n----Page Break----\nput on weight, and the lines of her face had\ncoarsened; but her large brown eyes were full of\nwarmth as she answered, \u2018Bella, it is, Mr Harry, and\npleased to see you after all these years.\u2019\nHarry turned to his wife. \u2018Bella\u2019s an old \ufb02ame of\nmine, Louise,\u2019 he said. \u2018Head-over-heels in love with\nher, wasn\u2019t I, Bella?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what you say,\u2019 said Mrs Edge.\nLouise laughed. She said, \u2018My husband\u2019s very\nhappy seeing all his old friends again.\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Mrs Edge, \u2018we haven\u2019t forgotten you, Mr\nHarry. Seems like a fairy tale to think of you married\nand building up a new house instead of that ruined old\nKingsdean House.\u2019\n\u2018You look very well and blooming,\u2019 said Harry, and\nMrs Edge laughed and said there was nothing wrong\nwith her and what about that toothbrush?\nClarice, watching the ba\ufb04ed look on Miss Harmon\u2019s\nface, said to herself exultantly, Oh, well done, Harry.\nYou\u2019ve spiked their guns.\nVII\nDoctor Haydock said abruptly to his niece, \u2018What\u2019s all\nthis nonsense about old Mrs Murgatroyd hanging\nabout Kingsdean and shaking her \ufb01st and cursing the\nnew regime?\u2019\n\u2018It isn\u2019t nonsense. It\u2019s quite true. It\u2019s upset Louise a\ngood deal.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Tell her she needn\u2019t worry\u2014when the Murgatroyds\nwere caretakers they never stopped grumbling about\nthe place\u2014they only stayed because Murgatroyd\ndrank and couldn\u2019t get another job.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll tell her,\u2019 said Clarice doubtfully, \u2018but I don\u2019t\nthink she\u2019ll believe you. The old woman fairly screams\nwith rage.\u2019\n\u2018Always used to be fond of Harry as a boy. I can\u2019t\nunderstand it.\u2019\nClarice said, \u2018Oh, well\u2014they\u2019ll be rid of her soon.\nHarry\u2019s paying her passage to America.\u2019\nThree days later, Louise was thrown from her horse\nand killed.\nTwo men in a baker\u2019s van were witnesses of the\naccident. They saw Louise ride out of the gates, saw\nthe old woman spring up and stand in the road waving\nher arms and shouting, saw the horse start, swerve,\nand then bolt madly down the road, \ufb02inging Louise\nLaxton over his head.\nOne of them stood over the unconscious \ufb01gure, not\nknowing what to do, while the other rushed to the\nhouse to get help.\nHarry Laxton came running out, his face ghastly.\nThey took o\ufb00 a door of the van and carried her on it to\nthe house. She died without regaining consciousness\nand before the doctor arrived.\n(End of Doctor Haydock\u2019s manuscript.)\n\n----Page Break----\nVIII\nWhen Doctor Haydock arrived the following day, he was\npleased to note that there was a pink \ufb02ush in Miss Marple\u2019s\ncheek and decidedly more animation in her manner.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018what\u2019s the verdict?\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s the problem, Doctor Haydock?\u2019 countered Miss\nMarple.\n\u2018Oh, my dear lady, do I have to tell you that?\u2019\n\u2018I suppose,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018that it\u2019s the curious\nconduct of the caretaker. Why did she behave in that very\nodd way? People do mind being turned out of their old\nhomes. But it wasn\u2019t her home. In fact, she used to\ncomplain and grumble while she was there. Yes, it certainly\nlooks very \ufb01shy. What became of her, by the way?\u2019\n\u2018Did a bunk to Liverpool. The accident scared her.\nThought she\u2019d wait there for her boat.\u2019\n\u2018All very convenient for somebody,\u2019 said Miss Marple.\n\u2018Yes, I think the \u201cProblem of the Caretaker\u2019s Conduct\u201d can be\nsolved easily enough. Bribery, was it not?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s your solution?\u2019\n\u2018Well, if it wasn\u2019t natural for her to behave in that way,\nshe must have been \u201cputting on an act\u201d as people say, and\nthat means that somebody paid her to do what she did.\u2019\n\u2018And you know who that somebody was?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, I think so. Money again, I\u2019m afraid. And I\u2019ve always\nnoticed that gentlemen always tend to admire the same\n\n----Page Break----\ntype.\u2019\n\u2018Now I\u2019m out of my depth.\u2019\n\u2018No, no, it all hangs together. Harry Laxton admired Bella\nEdge, a dark, vivacious type. Your niece Clarice was the\nsame. But the poor little wife was quite a di\ufb00erent type\u2014\nfair-haired and clinging\u2014not his type at all. So he must have\nmarried her for her money. And murdered her for her\nmoney, too!\u2019\n\u2018You use the word \u201cmurder\u201d?\u2019\n\u2018Well, he sounds the right type. Attractive to women and\nquite unscrupulous. I suppose he wanted to keep his wife\u2019s\nmoney and marry your niece. He may have been seen\ntalking to Mrs Edge. But I don\u2019t fancy he was attached to her\nany more. Though I dare say he made the poor woman think\nhe was, for ends of his own. He soon had her well under his\nthumb, I fancy.\u2019\n\u2018How exactly did he murder her, do you think?\u2019\nMiss Marple stared ahead of her for some minutes with\ndreamy blue eyes.\n\u2018It was very well timed\u2014with the baker\u2019s van as witness.\nThey could see the old woman and, of course, they\u2019d put\ndown the horse\u2019s fright to that. But I should imagine, myself,\nthat an air gun, or perhaps a catapult. Yes, just as the horse\ncame through the gates. The horse bolted, of course, and\nMrs Laxton was thrown.\u2019\nShe paused, frowning.\n\u2018The fall might have killed her. But he couldn\u2019t be sure of\nthat. And he seems the sort of man who would lay his plans\n\n----Page Break----\ncarefully and leave nothing to chance. After all, Mrs Edge\ncould get him something suitable without her husband\nknowing. Otherwise, why would Harry bother with her? Yes, I\nthink he had some powerful drug handy, that could be\nadministered before you arrived. After all, if a woman is\nthrown from her horse and has serious injuries and dies\nwithout recovering consciousness, well\u2014a doctor wouldn\u2019t\nnormally be suspicious, would he? He\u2019d put it down to shock\nor something.\u2019\nDoctor Haydock nodded.\n\u2018Why did you suspect?\u2019 asked Miss Marple.\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t any particular cleverness on my part,\u2019 said\nDoctor Haydock. \u2018It was just the trite, well-known fact that a\nmurderer is so pleased with his cleverness that he doesn\u2019t\ntake proper precautions. I was just saying a few consolatory\nwords to the bereaved husband\u2014and feeling damned sorry\nfor the fellow, too\u2014when he \ufb02ung himself down on the\nsettee to do a bit of play-acting and a hypodermic syringe\nfell out of his pocket.\n\u2018He snatched it up and looked so scared that I began to\nthink. Harry Laxton didn\u2019t drug; he was in perfect health;\nwhat was he doing with a hypodermic syringe? I did the\nautopsy with a view to certain possibilities. I found\nstrophanthin. The rest was easy. There was strophanthin in\nLaxton\u2019s possession, and Bella Edge, questioned by the\npolice, broke down and admitted to having got it for him.\nAnd \ufb01nally old Mrs Murgatroyd confessed that it was Harry\nLaxton who had put her up to the cursing stunt.\u2019\n\u2018And your niece got over it?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, she was attracted by the fellow, but it hadn\u2019t gone\nfar.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThe doctor picked up his manuscript.\n\u2018Full marks to you, Miss Marple\u2014and full marks to me for\nmy prescription. You\u2019re looking almost yourself again.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Case of the Perfect Maid\nI\n\u2018Oh, if you please, madam, could I speak to you a moment?\u2019\nIt might be thought that this request was in the nature of\nan absurdity, since Edna, Miss Marple\u2019s little maid, was\nactually speaking to her mistress at the moment.\nRecognizing the idiom, however, Miss Marple said\npromptly, \u2018Certainly, Edna, come in and shut the door. What\nis it?\u2019\nObediently shutting the door, Edna advanced into the\nroom, pleated the corner of her apron between her \ufb01ngers,\nand swallowed once or twice.\n\u2018Yes, Edna?\u2019 said Miss Marple encouragingly.\n\u2018Oh, please, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s my cousin, Gladdie.\u2019\n\u2018Dear me,\u2019 said Miss Marple, her mind leaping to the\nworst\u2014and, alas, the most usual conclusion. \u2018Not\u2014not in\ntrouble?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nEdna hastened to reassure her. \u2018Oh, no, ma\u2019am, nothing\nof that kind. Gladdie\u2019s not that kind of girl. It\u2019s just that\nshe\u2019s upset. You see, she\u2019s lost her place.\u2019\n\u2018Dear me, I am sorry to hear that. She was at Old Hall,\nwasn\u2019t she, with the Miss\u2014Misses\u2014Skinner?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s right, ma\u2019am. And Gladdie\u2019s very\nupset about it\u2014very upset indeed.\u2019\n\u2018Gladys has changed places rather often before, though,\nhasn\u2019t she?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, yes, ma\u2019am. She\u2019s always one for a change, Gladdie\nis. She never seems to get really settled, if you know what I\nmean. But she\u2019s always been the one to give the notice, you\nsee!\u2019\n\u2018And this time it\u2019s the other way round?\u2019 asked Miss\nMarple dryly.\n\u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, and it\u2019s upset Gladdie something awful.\u2019\nMiss Marple looked slightly surprised. Her recollection of\nGladys, who had occasionally come to drink tea in the\nkitchen on her \u2018days out\u2019, was a stout, giggling girl of\nunshakably equable temperament.\nEdna went on. \u2018You see, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s the way it happened\n\u2014the way Miss Skinner looked.\u2019\n\u2018How,\u2019 enquired Miss Marple patiently, \u2018did Miss Skinner\nlook?\u2019\nThis time Edna got well away with her news bulletin.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh, ma\u2019am, it was ever such a shock to Gladdie. You see,\none of Miss Emily\u2019s brooches was missing, and such a hue\nand cry for it as never was, and of course nobody likes a\nthing like that to happen; it\u2019s upsetting, ma\u2019am, if you know\nwhat I mean. And Gladdie\u2019s helped search everywhere, and\nthere was Miss Lavinia saying she was going to the police\nabout it, and then it turned up again, pushed right to the\nback of a drawer in the dressing-table, and very thankful\nGladdie was.\n\u2018And the very next day as ever was a plate got broken,\nand Miss Lavinia she bounced out right away and told\nGladdie to take a month\u2019s notice. And what Gladdie feels is\nit couldn\u2019t have been the plate and that Miss Lavinia was\njust making an excuse of that, and that it must be because\nof the brooch and they think as she took it and put it back\nwhen the police was mentioned, and Gladdie wouldn\u2019t do\nsuch a thing, not never she wouldn\u2019t, and what she feels is\nas it will get round and tell against her and it\u2019s a very\nserious thing for a girl, as you know, ma\u2019am.\u2019\nMiss Marple nodded. Though having no particular liking\nfor the bouncing, self-opinionated Gladys, she was quite\nsure of the girl\u2019s intrinsic honesty and could well imagine\nthat the a\ufb00air must have upset her.\nEdna said wistfully, \u2018I suppose, ma\u2019am, there isn\u2019t\nanything you could do about it? Gladdie\u2019s in ever such a\ntaking.\u2019\n\u2018Tell her not to be silly,\u2019 said Miss Marple crisply. \u2018If she\ndidn\u2019t take the brooch\u2014which I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t\u2014then she\nhas no cause to be upset.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019ll get about,\u2019 said Edna dismally.\n\n----Page Break----\nMiss Marple said, \u2018I\u2014er\u2014am going up that way this\nafternoon. I\u2019ll have a word with the Misses Skinner.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, thank you, madam,\u2019 said Edna.\nII\nOld Hall was a big Victorian house surrounded by woods and\npark land. Since it had been proved unlettable and\nunsaleable as it was, an enterprising speculator had divided\nit into four \ufb02ats with a central hot-water system, and the\nuse of \u2018the grounds\u2019 to be held in common by the tenants.\nThe experiment had been satisfactory. A rich and eccentric\nold lady and her maid occupied one \ufb02at. The old lady had a\npassion for birds and entertained a feathered gathering to\nmeals every day. A retired Indian judge and his wife rented a\nsecond. A very young couple, recently married, occupied the\nthird, and the fourth had been taken only two months ago\nby two maiden ladies of the name of Skinner. The four sets\nof tenants were only on the most distant terms with each\nother, since none of them had anything in common. The\nlandlord had been heard to say that this was an excellent\nthing. What he dreaded were friendships followed by\nestrangements and subsequent complaints to him.\nMiss Marple was acquainted with all the tenants, though\nshe knew none of them well. The elder Miss Skinner, Miss\nLavinia, was what might be termed the working member of\nthe \ufb01rm, Miss Emily, the younger, spent most of her time in\nbed su\ufb00ering from various complaints which, in the opinion\nof St Mary Mead, were largely imaginary. Only Miss Lavinia\nbelieved devoutly in her sister\u2019s martyrdom and patience\nunder a\ufb04iction, and willingly ran errands and trotted up and\ndown to the village for things that \u2018my sister had suddenly\nfancied\u2019.\n\n----Page Break----\nIt was the view of St Mary Mead that if Miss Emily\nsu\ufb00ered half as much as she said she did, she would have\nsent for Doctor Haydock long ago. But Miss Emily, when this\nwas hinted to her, shut her eyes in a superior way and\nmurmured that her case was not a simple one\u2014the best\nspecialists in London had been ba\ufb04ed by it\u2014and that a\nwonderful new man had put her on a most revolutionary\ncourse of treatment and that she really hoped her health\nwould improve under it. No humdrum GP could possibly\nunderstand her case.\n\u2018And it\u2019s my opinion,\u2019 said the outspoken Miss Hartnell,\n\u2018that she\u2019s very wise not to send for him. Dear Doctor\nHaydock, in that breezy manner of his, would tell her that\nthere was nothing the matter with her and to get up and not\nmake a fuss! Do her a lot of good!\u2019\nFailing such arbitrary treatment, however, Miss Emily\ncontinued to lie on sofas, to surround herself with strange\nlittle pill boxes, and to reject nearly everything that had\nbeen cooked for her and ask for something else\u2014usually\nsomething di\ufb03cult and inconvenient to get.\nIII\nThe door was opened to Miss Marple by \u2018Gladdie\u2019, looking\nmore depressed than Miss Marple had ever thought\npossible. In the sitting-room (a quarter of the late drawing-\nroom, which had been partitioned into a dining-room,\ndrawing-room, bathroom, and housemaid\u2019s cupboard), Miss\nLavinia rose to greet Miss Marple.\nLavinia Skinner was a tall, gaunt, bony female of \ufb01fty.\nShe had a gru\ufb00 voice and an abrupt manner.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Nice to see you,\u2019 she said. \u2018Emily\u2019s lying down\u2014feeling\nlow today, poor dear. Hope she\u2019ll see you, it would cheer her\nup, but there are times when she doesn\u2019t feel up to seeing\nanybody. Poor dear, she\u2019s wonderfully patient.\u2019\nMiss Marple responded politely. Servants were the main\ntopic of conversation in St Mary Mead, so it was not di\ufb03cult\nto lead the conversation in that direction. Miss Marple said\nshe had heard that that nice girl, Gladys Holmes, was\nleaving.\nMiss Lavinia nodded. \u2018Wednesday week. Broke things,\nyou know. Can\u2019t have that.\u2019\nMiss Marple sighed and said we all had to put up with\nthings nowadays. It was so di\ufb03cult to get girls to come to\nthe country. Did Miss Skinner really think it was wise to part\nwith Gladys?\n\u2018Know it\u2019s di\ufb03cult to get servants,\u2019 admitted Miss Lavinia.\n\u2018The Devereuxs haven\u2019t got anybody\u2014but then, I don\u2019t\nwonder\u2014always quarrelling, jazz on all night\u2014meals any\ntime\u2014that girl knows nothing of housekeeping. I pity her\nhusband! Then the Larkins have just lost their maid. Of\ncourse, what with the judge\u2019s Indian temper and his wanting\nchota hazri, as he calls it, at six in the morning and Mrs\nLarkin always fussing, I don\u2019t wonder at that, either. Mrs\nCarmichael\u2019s Janet is a \ufb01xture of course\u2014though in my\nopinion she\u2019s the most disagreeable woman, and absolutely\nbullies the old lady.\u2019\n\u2018Then don\u2019t you think you might reconsider your decision\nabout Gladys? She really is a nice girl. I know all her family;\nvery honest and superior.\u2019\nMiss Lavinia shook her head.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019ve got my reasons,\u2019 she said importantly.\nMiss Marple murmured, \u2018You missed a brooch, I\nunderstand\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Now, who has been talking? I suppose the girl has. Quite\nfrankly, I\u2019m almost certain she took it. And then got\nfrightened and put it back\u2014but, of course, one can\u2019t say\nanything unless one is sure.\u2019 She changed the subject. \u2018Do\ncome and see Emily, Miss Marple. I\u2019m sure it would do her\ngood.\u2019\nMiss Marple followed meekly to where Miss Lavinia\nknocked on a door, was bidden enter, and ushered her\nguest into the best room in the \ufb02at, most of the light of\nwhich was excluded by half-drawn blinds. Miss Emily was\nlying in bed, apparently enjoying the half-gloom and her\nown inde\ufb01nite su\ufb00erings.\nThe dim light showed her to be a thin, indecisive-looking\ncreature, with a good deal of greyish-yellow hair untidily\nwound around her head and erupting into curls, the whole\nthing looking like a bird\u2019s nest of which no self-respecting\nbird could be proud. There was a smell in the room of Eau\nde Cologne, stale biscuits, and camphor.\nWith half-closed eyes and a thin, weak voice, Emily\nSkinner explained that this was \u2018one of her bad days\u2019.\n\u2018The worst of ill health is,\u2019 said Miss Emily in a\nmelancholy tone, \u2018that one knows what a burden one is to\neveryone around one.\n\u2018Lavinia is very good to me. Lavvie dear, I do so hate\ngiving trouble but if my hot-water bottle could only be \ufb01lled\nin the way I like it\u2014too full it weighs on me so\u2014on the other\nhand, if it is not su\ufb03ciently \ufb01lled, it gets cold immediately!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, dear. Give it to me. I will empty a little out.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps, if you\u2019re doing that, it might be re\ufb01lled. There\nare no rusks in the house, I suppose\u2014no, no, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter. I can do without. Some weak tea and a slice of\nlemon\u2014no lemons? No, really, I couldn\u2019t drink tea without\nlemon. I think the milk was slightly turned this morning. It\nhas put me against milk in my tea. It doesn\u2019t matter. I can\ndo without my tea. Only I do feel so weak. Oysters, they say,\nare nourishing. I wonder if I could fancy a few? No, no, too\nmuch bother to get hold of them so late in the day. I can fast\nuntil tomorrow.\u2019\nLavinia left the room murmuring something incoherent\nabout bicycling down to the village.\nMiss Emily smiled feebly at her guest and remarked that\nshe did hate giving anyone any trouble.\nMiss Marple told Edna that evening that she was afraid\nher embassy had met with no success.\nShe was rather troubled to \ufb01nd that rumours as to\nGladys\u2019s dishonesty were already going around the village.\nIn the post o\ufb03ce, Miss Wetherby tackled her. \u2018My dear\nJane, they gave her a written reference saying she was\nwilling and sober and respectable, but saying nothing about\nhonesty. That seems to me most signi\ufb01cant! I hear there\nwas some trouble about a brooch. I think there must be\nsomething in it, you know, because one doesn\u2019t let a\nservant go nowadays unless it\u2019s something rather grave.\nThey\u2019ll \ufb01nd it most di\ufb03cult to get anyone else. Girls simply\nwill not go to Old Hall. They\u2019re nervous coming home on\ntheir days out. You\u2019ll see, the Skinners won\u2019t \ufb01nd anyone\nelse, and then, perhaps, that dreadful hypochondriac sister\nwill have to get up and do something!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nGreat was the chagrin of the village when it was made\nknown that the Misses Skinner had engaged, from an\nagency, a new maid who, by all accounts, was a perfect\nparagon.\n\u2018A three-years\u2019 reference recommending her most\nwarmly, she prefers the country, and actually asks less\nwages than Gladys. I really feel we have been most\nfortunate.\u2019\n\u2018Well, really,\u2019 said Miss Marple, to whom these details\nwere imparted by Miss Lavinia in the \ufb01shmonger\u2019s shop. \u2018It\ndoes seem too good to be true.\u2019\nIt then became the opinion of St Mary Mead that the\nparagon would cry o\ufb00 at the last minute and fail to arrive.\nNone of these prognostications came true, however, and\nthe village was able to observe the domestic treasure, by\nname, Mary Higgins, driving through the village in Reed\u2019s\ntaxi to Old Hall. It had to be admitted that her appearance\nwas good. A most respectable-looking woman, very neatly\ndressed.\nWhen Miss Marple next visited Old Hall, on the occasion\nof recruiting stall-holders for the vicarage fete, Mary Higgins\nopened the door. She was certainly a most superior-looking\nmaid, at a guess forty years of age, with neat black hair,\nrosy cheeks, a plump \ufb01gure discreetly arrayed in black with\na white apron and cap\u2014\u2018quite the good, old-fashioned type\nof servant,\u2019 as Miss Marple explained afterwards, and with\nthe proper, inaudible respectful voice, so di\ufb00erent from the\nloud but adenoidal accents of Gladys.\nMiss Lavinia was looking far less harassed than usual\nand, although she regretted that she could not take a stall\nowing to her preoccupation with her sister, she nevertheless\n\n----Page Break----\ntendered a handsome monetary contribution, and promised\nto produce a consignment of pen-wipers and babies\u2019 socks.\nMiss Marple commented on her air of well-being.\n\u2018I really feel I owe a great deal to Mary, I am so thankful I\nhad the resolution to get rid of that other girl. Mary is really\ninvaluable. Cooks nicely and waits beautifully and keeps our\nlittle \ufb02at scrupulously clean\u2014mattresses turned over every\nday. And she is really wonderful with Emily!\u2019\nMiss Marple hastily enquired after Emily.\n\u2018Oh, poor dear, she has been very much under the\nweather lately. She can\u2019t help it, of course, but it really\nmakes things a little di\ufb03cult sometimes. Wanting certain\nthings cooked and then, when they come, saying she can\u2019t\neat now\u2014and then wanting them again half an hour later\nand everything spoiled and having to be done again. It\nmakes, of course, a lot of work\u2014but fortunately Mary does\nnot seem to mind at all. She\u2019s used to waiting on invalids,\nshe says, and understands them. It is such a comfort.\u2019\n\u2018Dear me,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018You are fortunate.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, indeed. I really feel Mary has been sent to us as an\nanswer to prayer.\u2019\n\u2018She sounds to me,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018almost too good to\nbe true. I should\u2014well, I should be a little careful if I were\nyou.\u2019\nLavinia Skinner failed to perceive the point of this\nremark. She said, \u2018Oh! I assure you I do all I can to make her\ncomfortable. I don\u2019t know what I should do if she left.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I don\u2019t expect she\u2019ll leave until she\u2019s ready to leave,\u2019\nsaid Miss Marple and stared very hard at her hostess.\nMiss Lavinia said, \u2018If one has no domestic worries, it\ntakes such a load o\ufb00 one\u2019s mind, doesn\u2019t it? How is your\nlittle Edna shaping?\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s doing quite nicely. Not much head, of course. Not\nlike your Mary. Still, I do know all about Edna because she\u2019s\na village girl.\u2019\nAs she went out into the hall she heard the invalid\u2019s\nvoice fretfully raised. \u2018This compress has been allowed to\nget quite dry\u2014Doctor Allerton particularly said moisture\ncontinually renewed. There, there, leave it. I want a cup of\ntea and a boiled egg\u2014boiled only three minutes and a half,\nremember, and send Miss Lavinia to me.\u2019\nThe e\ufb03cient Mary emerged from the bedroom and,\nsaying to Lavinia, \u2018Miss Emily is asking for you, madam,\u2019\nproceeded to open the door for Miss Marple, helping her into\nher coat and handing her her umbrella in the most\nirreproachable fashion.\nMiss Marple took the umbrella, dropped it, tried to pick it\nup, and dropped her bag, which \ufb02ew open. Mary politely\nretrieved various odds and ends\u2014a handkerchief, an\nengagement book, an old-fashioned leather purse, two\nshillings, three pennies, and a striped piece of peppermint\nrock.\nMiss Marple received the last with some signs of\nconfusion.\n\u2018Oh, dear, that must have been Mrs Clement\u2019s little boy.\nHe was sucking it, I remember, and he took my bag to play\nwith. He must have put it inside. It\u2019s terribly sticky, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Shall I take it, madam?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, would you? Thank you so much.\u2019\nMary stooped to retrieve the last item, a small mirror,\nupon recovering which Miss Marple exclaimed fervently,\n\u2018How lucky, now, that that isn\u2019t broken.\u2019\nShe thereupon departed, Mary standing politely by the\ndoor holding a piece of striped rock with a completely\nexpressionless face.\nIV\nFor ten days longer St Mary Mead had to endure hearing of\nthe excellencies of Miss Lavinia\u2019s and Miss Emily\u2019s treasure.\nOn the eleventh day, the village awoke to its big thrill.\nMary, the paragon, was missing! Her bed had not been\nslept in, and the front door was found ajar. She had slipped\nout quietly during the night.\nAnd not Mary alone was missing! Two brooches and \ufb01ve\nrings of Miss Lavinia\u2019s; three rings, a pendant, a bracelet,\nand four brooches of Miss Emily\u2019s were missing, also!\nIt was the beginning of a chapter of catastrophe.\nYoung Mrs Devereux had lost her diamonds which she\nkept in an unlocked drawer and also some valuable furs\ngiven to her as a wedding present. The judge and his wife\nalso had had jewellery taken and a certain amount of\nmoney. Mrs Carmichael was the greatest su\ufb00erer. Not only\nhad she some very valuable jewels but she also kept in the\n\ufb02at a large sum of money which had gone. It had been\n\n----Page Break----\nJanet\u2019s evening out, and her mistress was in the habit of\nwalking round the gardens at dusk calling to the birds and\nscattering crumbs. It seemed clear that Mary, the perfect\nmaid, had had keys to \ufb01t all the \ufb02ats!\nThere was, it must be confessed, a certain amount of ill-\nnatured pleasure in St Mary Mead. Miss Lavinia had boasted\nso much of her marvellous Mary.\n\u2018And all the time, my dear, just a common thief!\u2019\nInteresting revelations followed. Not only had Mary\ndisappeared into the blue, but the agency who had provided\nher and vouched for her credentials was alarmed to \ufb01nd\nthat the Mary Higgins who had applied to them and whose\nreferences they had taken up had, to all intents and\npurposes, never existed. It was the name of a bona \ufb01de\nservant who had lived with the bona \ufb01de sister of a dean,\nbut the real Mary Higgins was existing peacefully in a place\nin Cornwall.\n\u2018Damned clever, the whole thing,\u2019 Inspector Slack was\nforced to admit. \u2018And, if you ask me, that woman works with\na gang. There was a case of much the same kind in\nNorthumberland a year ago. Stu\ufb00 was never traced, and\nthey never caught her. However, we\u2019ll do better than that in\nMuch Benham!\u2019\nInspector Slack was always a con\ufb01dent man.\nNevertheless, weeks passed, and Mary Higgins remained\ntriumphantly at large. In vain Inspector Slack redoubled that\nenergy that so belied his name.\nMiss Lavinia remained tearful. Miss Emily was so upset,\nand felt so alarmed by her condition that she actually sent\nfor Doctor Haydock.\n\n----Page Break----\nThe whole of the village was terribly anxious to know\nwhat he thought of Miss Emily\u2019s claims to ill health, but\nnaturally could not ask him. Satisfactory data came to hand\non the subject, however, through Mr Meek, the chemist\u2019s\nassistant, who was walking out with Clara, Mrs Price-Ridley\u2019s\nmaid. It was then known that Doctor Haydock had\nprescribed a mixture of asafoetida and valerian which,\naccording to Mr Meek, was the stock remedy for malingerers\nin the army!\nSoon afterwards it was learned that Miss Emily, not\nrelishing the medical attention she had had, was declaring\nthat in the state of her health she felt it her duty to be near\nthe specialist in London who understood her case. It was,\nshe said, only fair to Lavinia.\nThe \ufb02at was put up for subletting.\nV\nIt was a few days after that that Miss Marple, rather pink\nand \ufb02ustered, called at the police station in Much Benham\nand asked for Inspector Slack.\nInspector Slack did not like Miss Marple. But he was\naware that the Chief Constable, Colonel Melchett, did not\nshare that opinion. Rather grudgingly, therefore, he received\nher.\n\u2018Good afternoon, Miss Marple, what can I do for you?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re in a hurry.\u2019\n\u2018Lots of work on,\u2019 said Inspector Slack, \u2018but I can spare a\nfew moments.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Oh dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018I hope I shall be able to put\nwhat I say properly. So di\ufb03cult, you know, to explain\noneself, don\u2019t you think? No, perhaps you don\u2019t. But you\nsee, not having been educated in the modern style\u2014just a\ngoverness, you know, who taught one the dates of the kings\nof England and general knowledge\u2014Doctor Brewer\u2014three\nkinds of diseases of wheat\u2014blight, mildew\u2014now what was\nthe third\u2014was it smut?\u2019\n\u2018Do you want to talk about smut?\u2019 asked Inspector Slack\nand then blushed.\n\u2018Oh, no, no.\u2019 Miss Marple hastily disclaimed any wish to\ntalk about smut. \u2018Just an illustration, you know. And how\nneedles are made, and all that. Discursive, you know, but\nnot teaching one to keep to the point. Which is what I want\nto do. It\u2019s about Miss Skinner\u2019s maid, Gladys, you know.\u2019\n\u2018Mary Higgins,\u2019 said Inspector Slack.\n\u2018Oh, yes, the second maid. But it\u2019s Gladys Holmes I mean\n\u2014rather an impertinent girl and far too pleased with herself\nbut really strictly honest, and it\u2019s so important that that\nshould be recognized.\u2019\n\u2018No charge against her so far as I know,\u2019 said the\ninspector.\n\u2018No, I know there isn\u2019t a charge\u2014but that makes it worse.\nBecause, you see, people go on thinking things. Oh, dear\u2014I\nknew I should explain things badly. What I really mean is\nthat the important thing is to \ufb01nd Mary Higgins.\u2019\n\u2018Certainly,\u2019 said Inspector Slack. \u2018Have you any ideas on\nthe subject?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, as a matter of fact, I have,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018May I\nask you a question? Are \ufb01ngerprints of no use to you?\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Inspector Slack, \u2018that\u2019s where she was a bit too\nartful for us. Did most of her work in rubber gloves or\nhousemaid\u2019s gloves, it seems. And she\u2019d been careful\u2014\nwiped o\ufb00 everything in her bedroom and on the sink.\nCouldn\u2019t \ufb01nd a single \ufb01ngerprint in the place!\u2019\n\u2018If you did have \ufb01ngerprints, would it help?\u2019\n\u2018It might, madam. They may be known at the Yard. This\nisn\u2019t her \ufb01rst job, I\u2019d say!\u2019\nMiss Marple nodded brightly. She opened her bag and\nextracted a small cardboard box. Inside it, wedged in cotton\nwool, was a small mirror.\n\u2018From my handbag,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018The maid\u2019s prints\nare on it. I think they should be satisfactory\u2014she touched\nan extremely sticky substance a moment previously.\u2019\nInspector Slack stared. \u2018Did you get her \ufb01ngerprints on\npurpose?\u2019\n\u2018Of course.\u2019\n\u2018You suspected her then?\u2019\n\u2018Well, you know, it did strike me that she was a little too\ngood to be true. I practically told Miss Lavinia so. But she\nsimply wouldn\u2019t take the hint! I\u2019m afraid, you know,\nInspector, that I don\u2019t believe in paragons. Most of us have\nour faults\u2014and domestic service shows them up very\nquickly!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Inspector Slack, recovering his balance, \u2018I\u2019m\nobliged to you, I\u2019m sure. We\u2019ll send these up to the Yard and\nsee what they have to say.\u2019\nHe stopped. Miss Marple had put her head a little on one\nside and was regarding him with a good deal of meaning.\n\u2018You wouldn\u2019t consider, I suppose, Inspector, looking a\nlittle nearer home?\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean, Miss Marple?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s very di\ufb03cult to explain, but when you come across a\npeculiar thing you notice it. Although, often, peculiar things\nmay be the merest tri\ufb02es. I\u2019ve felt that all along, you know; I\nmean about Gladys and the brooch. She\u2019s an honest girl;\nshe didn\u2019t take that brooch. Then why did Miss Skinner think\nshe did? Miss Skinner\u2019s not a fool; far from it! Why was she\nso anxious to let a girl go who was a good servant when\nservants are hard to get? It was peculiar, you know. So I\nwondered. I wondered a good deal. And I noticed another\npeculiar thing! Miss Emily\u2019s a hypochondriac, but she\u2019s the\n\ufb01rst hypochondriac who hasn\u2019t sent for some doctor or other\nat once. Hypochondriacs love doctors, Miss Emily didn\u2019t!\u2019\n\u2018What are you suggesting, Miss Marple?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I\u2019m suggesting, you know, that Miss Lavinia and\nMiss Emily are peculiar people. Miss Emily spends nearly all\nher time in a dark room. And if that hair of hers isn\u2019t a wig I\n\u2014I\u2019ll eat my own back switch! And what I say is this\u2014it\u2019s\nperfectly possible for a thin, pale, grey-haired, whining\nwoman to be the same as a black-haired, rosy-cheeked,\nplump woman. And nobody that I can \ufb01nd ever saw Miss\nEmily and Mary Higgins at one and the same time.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Plenty of time to get impressions of all the keys, plenty\nof time to \ufb01nd out all about the other tenants, and then\u2014get\nrid of the local girl. Miss Emily takes a brisk walk across\ncountry one night and arrives at the station as Mary Higgins\nnext day. And then, at the right moment, Mary Higgins\ndisappears, and o\ufb00 goes the hue and cry after her. I\u2019ll tell\nyou where you\u2019ll \ufb01nd her, Inspector. On Miss Emily Skinner\u2019s\nsofa! Get her \ufb01ngerprints if you don\u2019t believe me, but you\u2019ll\n\ufb01nd I\u2019m right! A couple of clever thieves, that\u2019s what the\nSkinners are\u2014and no doubt in league with a clever post and\nrails or fence or whatever you call it. But they won\u2019t get\naway with it this time! I\u2019m not going to have one of our\nvillage girls\u2019 character for honesty taken away like that!\nGladys Holmes is as honest as the day, and everybody\u2019s\ngoing to know it! Good afternoon!\u2019\nMiss Marple had stalked out before Inspector Slack had\nrecovered.\n\u2018Whew?\u2019 he muttered. \u2018I wonder if she\u2019s right?\u2019\nHe soon found out that Miss Marple was right again.\nColonel Melchett congratulated Slack on his e\ufb03ciency,\nand Miss Marple had Gladys come to tea with Edna and\nspoke to her seriously on settling down in a good situation\nwhen she got one.\n\n----Page Break----\nMiss Marple Tells a Story\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever told you, my dears\u2014you, Raymond,\nand you, Joan, about the rather curious little business that\nhappened some years ago now. I don\u2019t want to seem vain in\nany way\u2014of course I know that in comparison with you\nyoung people I\u2019m not clever at all\u2014Raymond writes those\nvery modern books all about rather unpleasant young men\nand women\u2014and Joan paints those very remarkable\npictures of square people with curious bulges on them\u2014very\nclever of you, my dear, but as Raymond always says (only\nquite kindly, because he is the kindest of nephews) I am\nhopelessly Victorian. I admire Mr Alma-Tadema and Mr\nFrederic Leighton and I suppose to you they seem\nhopelessly vieux jeu. Now let me see, what was I saying?\nOh, yes\u2014that I didn\u2019t want to appear vain\u2014but I couldn\u2019t\nhelp being just a teeny weeny bit pleased with myself,\nbecause, just by applying a little common sense, I believe I\nreally did solve a problem that had ba\ufb04ed cleverer heads\nthan mine. Though really I should have thought the whole\nthing was obvious from the beginning\u2026\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you my little story, and if you think I\u2019m\ninclined to be conceited about it, you must remember that I\n\n----Page Break----\ndid at least help a fellow creature who was in very grave\ndistress.\nThe \ufb01rst I knew of this business was one evening about\nnine o\u2019clock when Gwen\u2014(you remember Gwen? My little\nmaid with red hair) well\u2014Gwen came in and told me that Mr\nPetherick and a gentleman had called to see me. Gwen had\nshown them into the drawing-room\u2014quite rightly. I was\nsitting in the dining-room because in early spring I think it is\nso wasteful to have two \ufb01res going.\nI directed Gwen to bring in the cherry brandy and some\nglasses and I hurried into the drawing-room. I don\u2019t know\nwhether you remember Mr Petherick? He died two years\nago, but he had been a friend of mine for many years as\nwell as attending to all my legal business. A very shrewd\nman and a really clever solicitor. His son does my business\nfor me now\u2014a very nice lad and very up to date\u2014but\nsomehow I don\u2019t feel quite the con\ufb01dence I had with Mr\nPetherick.\nI explained to Mr Petherick about the \ufb01res and he said at\nonce that he and his friend would come into the dining-room\n\u2014and then he introduced his friend\u2014a Mr Rhodes. He was a\nyoungish man\u2014not much over forty\u2014and I saw at once\nthere was something very wrong. His manner was most\npeculiar. One might have called it rude if one hadn\u2019t realized\nthat the poor fellow was su\ufb00ering from strain.\nWhen we were settled in the dining-room and Gwen had\nbrought the cherry brandy, Mr Petherick explained the\nreason for his visit.\n\u2018Miss Marple,\u2019 he said, \u2018you must forgive an old friend for\ntaking a liberty. What I have come here for is a\nconsultation.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nI couldn\u2019t understand at all what he meant, and he went\non:\n\u2018In a case of illness one likes two points of view\u2014that of\nthe specialist and that of the family physician. It is the\nfashion to regard the former as of more value, but I am not\nsure that I agree. The specialist has experience only in his\nown \nsubject\u2014the \nfamily \ndoctor \nhas, \nperhaps, \nless\nknowledge\u2014but a wider experience.\u2019\nI knew just what he meant, because a young niece of\nmine not long before had hurried her child o\ufb00 to a very well-\nknown specialist in skin diseases without consulting her own\ndoctor whom she considered an old dodderer, and the\nspecialist had ordered some very expensive treatment, and\nlater found that all the child was su\ufb00ering from was a rather\nunusual form of measles.\nI just mention this\u2014though I have a horror of digressing\u2014\nto show that I appreciate Mr Petherick\u2019s point\u2014but I still\nhadn\u2019t any idea what he was driving at.\n\u2018If Mr Rhodes is ill\u2014\u2019 I said, and stopped\u2014because the\npoor man gave a most dreadful laugh.\nHe said: \u2018I expect to die of a broken neck in a few\nmonths\u2019 time.\u2019\nAnd then it all came out. There had been a case of\nmurder lately in Barnchester\u2014a town about twenty miles\naway. I\u2019m afraid I hadn\u2019t paid much attention to it at the\ntime, because we had been having a lot of excitement in the\nvillage about our district nurse, and outside occurrences like\nan earthquake in India and a murder in Barnchester,\nalthough of course far more important really\u2014had given\nway to our own little local excitements. I\u2019m afraid villages\nare like that. Still, I did remember having read about a\n\n----Page Break----\nwoman having been stabbed in a hotel, though I hadn\u2019t\nremembered her name. But now it seemed that this woman\nhad been Mr Rhodes\u2019s wife\u2014and as if that wasn\u2019t bad\nenough\u2014he was actually under suspicion of having\nmurdered her himself.\nAll this Mr Petherick explained to me very clearly, saying\nthat, although the Coronor\u2019s jury had brought in a verdict of\nmurder by a person or persons unknown, Mr Rhodes had\nreason to believe that he would probably be arrested within\na day or two, and that he had come to Mr Petherick and\nplaced himself in his hands. Mr Petherick went on to say\nthat they had that afternoon consulted Sir Malcolm Olde,\nK.C., and that in the event of the case coming to trial Sir\nMalcolm had been briefed to defend Mr Rhodes.\nSir Malcolm was a young man, Mr Petherick said, very up\nto date in his methods, and he had indicated a certain line\nof defence. But with that line of defence Mr Petherick was\nnot entirely satis\ufb01ed.\n\u2018You see, my dear lady,\u2019 he said, \u2018it is tainted with what I\ncall the specialist\u2019s point of view. Give Sir Malcolm a case\nand he sees only one point\u2014the most likely line of defence.\nBut even the best line of defence may ignore completely\nwhat is, to my mind, the vital point. It takes no account of\nwhat actually happened.\u2019\nThen he went on to say some very kind and \ufb02attering\nthings about my acumen and judgement and my knowledge\nof human nature, and asked permission to tell me the story\nof the case in the hopes that I might be able to suggest\nsome explanation.\nI could see that Mr Rhodes was highly sceptical of my\nbeing of any use and he was annoyed at being brought\n\n----Page Break----\nhere. But Mr Petherick took no notice and proceeded to give\nme the facts of what occurred on the night of March 8th.\nMr and Mrs Rhodes had been staying at the Crown Hotel\nin Barnchester. Mrs Rhodes who (so I gathered from Mr\nPetherick\u2019s careful language) was perhaps just a shade of a\nhypochondriac, had retired to bed immediately after dinner.\nShe and her husband occupied adjoining rooms with a\nconnecting door. Mr Rhodes, who is writing a book on\nprehistoric \ufb02ints, settled down to work in the adjoining\nroom. At eleven o\u2019clock he tidied up his papers and\nprepared to go to bed. Before doing so, he just glanced into\nhis wife\u2019s room to make sure that there was nothing she\nwanted. He discovered the electric light on and his wife\nlying in bed stabbed through the heart. She had been dead\nat least an hour\u2014probably longer. The following were the\npoints made. There was another door in Mrs Rhodes\u2019s room\nleading into the corridor. This door was locked and bolted on\nthe inside. The only window in the room was closed and\nlatched. According to Mr Rhodes nobody had passed\nthrough the room in which he was sitting except a\nchambermaid bringing hot-water bottles. The weapon found\nin the wound was a stiletto dagger which had been lying on\nMrs Rhodes\u2019s dressing-table. She was in the habit of using it\nas a paper knife. There were no \ufb01ngerprints on it.\nThe situation boiled down to this\u2014no one but Mr Rhodes\nand the chambermaid had entered the victim\u2019s room.\nI enquired about the chambermaid.\n\u2018That was our \ufb01rst line of enquiry,\u2019 said Mr Petherick.\n\u2018Mary Hill is a local woman. She had been chambermaid at\nthe Crown for ten years. There seems absolutely no reason\nwhy she should commit a sudden assault on a guest. She is,\nin any case, extraordinarily stupid, almost half-witted. Her\n\n----Page Break----\nstory has never varied. She brought Mrs Rhodes her hot-\nwater bottle and says the lady was drowsy\u2014just dropping\no\ufb00 to sleep. Frankly, I cannot believe, and I am sure no jury\nwould believe, that she committed the crime.\u2019\nMr Petherick went on to mention a few additional details.\nAt the head of the staircase in the Crown Hotel is a kind of\nminiature lounge where people sometimes sit and have\nco\ufb00ee. A passage goes o\ufb00 to the right and the last door in it\nis the door into the room occupied by Mr Rhodes. The\npassage then turns sharply to the right again and the \ufb01rst\ndoor round the corner is the door into Mrs Rhodes\u2019s room.\nAs it happened, both these doors could be seen by\nwitnesses. The \ufb01rst door\u2014that into Mr Rhodes\u2019s room, which\nI will call A, could be seen by four people, two commercial\ntravellers and an elderly married couple who were having\nco\ufb00ee. According to them nobody went in or out of door A\nexcept Mr Rhodes and the chambermaid. As to the other\ndoor in the passage B, there was an electrician at work\nthere and he also swears that nobody entered or left door B\nexcept the chambermaid.\nIt was certainly a very curious and interesting case. On\nthe face of it, it looked as though Mr Rhodes must have\nmurdered his wife. But I could see that Mr Petherick was\nquite convinced of his client\u2019s innocence and Mr Petherick\nwas a very shrewd man.\nAt the inquest Mr Rhodes had told a hesitating and\nrambling story about some woman who had written\nthreatening letters to his wife. His story, I gathered, had\nbeen unconvincing in the extreme. Appealed to by Mr\nPetherick, he explained himself.\n\u2018Frankly,\u2019 he said, \u2018I never believed it. I thought Amy had\nmade most of it up.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nMrs Rhodes, I gathered, was one of those romantic liars\nwho go through life embroidering everything that happens\nto them. The amount of adventures that, according to her\nown account, happened to her in a year was simply\nincredible. If she slipped on a bit of banana peel it was a\ncase of near escape from death. If a lampshade caught \ufb01re\nshe was rescued from a burning building at the hazard of\nher life. Her husband got into the habit of discounting her\nstatements. Her tale as to some woman whose child she\nhad injured in a motor accident and who had vowed\nvengeance on her\u2014well\u2014Mr Rhodes had simply not taken\nany notice of it. The incident had happened before he\nmarried his wife and although she had read him letters\ncouched in crazy language, he had suspected her of\ncomposing them herself. She had actually done such a thing\nonce or twice before. She was a woman of hysterical\ntendencies who craved ceaselessly for excitement.\nNow, all that seemed to me very natural\u2014indeed, we\nhave a young woman in the village who does much the\nsame thing. The danger with such people is that when\nanything at all extraordinary really does happen to them,\nnobody believes they are speaking the truth. It seemed to\nme that that was what had happened in this case. The\npolice, I gathered, merely believed that Mr Rhodes was\nmaking up this unconvincing tale in order to avert suspicion\nfrom himself.\nI asked if there had been any women staying by\nthemselves in the hotel. It seemed there were two\u2014a Mrs\nGranby, an Anglo-Indian widow, and a Miss Carruthers,\nrather a horsey spinster who dropped her g\u2019s. Mr Petherick\nadded that the most minute enquiries had failed to elicit\nanyone who had seen either of them near the scene of the\ncrime and there was nothing to connect either of them with\nit in any way. I asked him to describe their personal\n\n----Page Break----\nappearance. He said that Mrs Granby had reddish hair\nrather untidily done, was sallow-faced and about \ufb01fty years\nof age. Her clothes were rather picturesque, being made\nmostly of native silk, etc. Miss Carruthers was about forty,\nwore pince-nez, had close-cropped hair like a man and wore\nmannish coats and skirts.\n\u2018Dear me,\u2019 I said, \u2018that makes it very di\ufb03cult.\u2019\nMr Petherick looked enquiringly at me, but I didn\u2019t want\nto say any more just then, so I asked what Sir Malcolm Olde\nhad said.\nSir Malcolm was con\ufb01dent of being able to call con\ufb02icting\nmedical testimony and to suggest some way of getting over\nthe \ufb01ngerprint di\ufb03culty. I asked Mr Rhodes what he thought\nand he said all doctors were fools but he himself couldn\u2019t\nreally believe that his wife had killed herself. \u2018She wasn\u2019t\nthat kind of woman,\u2019 he said simply\u2014and I believed him.\nHysterical people don\u2019t usually commit suicide.\nI thought a minute and then I asked if the door from Mrs\nRhodes\u2019s room led straight into the corridor. Mr Rhodes said\nno\u2014there was a little hallway with a bathroom and lavatory.\nIt was the door from the bedroom to the hallway that was\nlocked and bolted on the inside.\n\u2018In that case,\u2019 I said, \u2018the whole thing seems remarkably\nsimple.\u2019\nAnd really, you know, it did\u2026the simplest thing in the\nworld. And yet no one seemed to have seen it that way.\nBoth Mr Petherick and Mr Rhodes were staring at me so\nthat I felt quite embarrassed.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Mr Rhodes, \u2018Miss Marple hasn\u2019t quite\nappreciated the di\ufb03culties.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 I said, \u2018I think I have. There are four possibilities.\nEither Mrs Rhodes was killed by her husband, or by the\nchambermaid, or she committed suicide, or she was killed\nby an outsider whom nobody saw enter or leave.\u2019\n\u2018And that\u2019s impossible,\u2019 Mr Rhodes broke in. \u2018Nobody\ncould come in or go out through my room without my seeing\nthem, and even if anyone did manage to come in through\nmy wife\u2019s room without the electrician seeing them, how the\ndevil could they get out again leaving the door locked and\nbolted on the inside?\u2019\nMr Petherick looked at me and said: \u2018Well, Miss Marple?\u2019\nin an encouraging manner.\n\u2018I should like,\u2019 I said, \u2018to ask a question. Mr Rhodes, what\ndid the chambermaid look like?\u2019\nHe said he wasn\u2019t sure\u2014she was tallish, he thought\u2014he\ndidn\u2019t remember if she was fair or dark. I turned to Mr\nPetherick and asked the same question.\nHe said she was of medium height, had fairish hair and\nblue eyes and rather a high colour.\nMr Rhodes said: \u2018You are a better observer than I am,\nPetherick.\u2019\nI ventured to disagree. I then asked Mr Rhodes if he could\ndescribe the maid in my house. Neither he nor Mr Petherick\ncould do so.\n\u2018Don\u2019t you see what that means?\u2019 I said. \u2018You both came\nhere full of your own a\ufb00airs and the person who let you in\n\n----Page Break----\nwas only a parlourmaid. The same applies to Mr Rhodes at\nthe hotel. He saw her uniform and her apron. He was\nengrossed by his work. But Mr Petherick has interviewed the\nsame woman in a di\ufb00erent capacity. He has looked at her as\na person.\n\u2018That\u2019s what the woman who did the murder counted\nupon.\u2019\nAs they still didn\u2019t see, I had to explain.\n\u2018I think,\u2019 I said, \u2018that this is how it went. The\nchambermaid came in by door A, passed through Mr\nRhodes\u2019s room into Mrs Rhodes\u2019s room with the hot-water\nbottle and went out through the hallway into passage B. X\u2014\nas I will call our murderess\u2014came in by door B into the little\nhallway, concealed herself in\u2014well, in a certain apartment,\nahem\u2014and waited until the chambermaid had passed out.\nThen she entered Mrs Rhodes\u2019s room, took the stiletto from\nthe dressing table (she had doubtless explored the room\nearlier in the day), went up to the bed, stabbed the dozing\nwoman, wiped the handle of the stiletto, locked and bolted\nthe door by which she had entered, and then passed out\nthrough the room where Mr Rhodes was working.\u2019\nMr Rhodes cried out: \u2018But I should have seen her. The\nelectrician would have seen her go in.\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018That\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. You wouldn\u2019t see\nher\u2014not if she were dressed as a chambermaid.\u2019 I let it sink\nin, then I went on, \u2018You were engrossed in your work\u2014out of\nthe tail of your eye you saw a chambermaid come in, go into\nyour wife\u2019s room, come back and go out. It was the same\ndress\u2014but not the same woman. That\u2019s what the people\nhaving \nco\ufb00ee \nsaw\u2014a \nchambermaid \ngo \nin \nand \na\nchambermaid come out. The electrician did the same. I dare\n\n----Page Break----\nsay if a chambermaid were very pretty a gentleman might\nnotice her face\u2014human nature being what it is\u2014but if she\nwere just an ordinary middle-aged woman\u2014well\u2014it would\nbe the chambermaid\u2019s dress you would see\u2014not the woman\nherself.\u2019\nMr Rhodes cried: \u2018Who was she?\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018that is going to be a little di\ufb03cult. It must\nbe either Mrs Granby or Miss Carruthers. Mrs Granby sounds\nas though she might wear a wig normally\u2014so she could\nwear her own hair as a chambermaid. On the other hand,\nMiss Carruthers with her close-cropped mannish head might\neasily put on a wig to play her part. I dare say you will \ufb01nd\nout easily enough which of them it is. Personally, I incline\nmyself to think it will be Miss Carruthers.\u2019\nAnd really, my dears, that is the end of the story.\nCarruthers was a false name, but she was the woman all\nright. There was insanity in her family. Mrs Rhodes, who was\na most reckless and dangerous driver, had run over her little\ngirl, and it had driven the poor woman o\ufb00 her head. She\nconcealed her madness very cunningly except for writing\ndistinctly insane latters to her intended victim. She had\nbeen following her about for some time, and she laid her\nplans very cleverly. The false hair and maid\u2019s dress she\nposted in a parcel \ufb01rst thing the next morning. When taxed\nwith the truth she broke down and confessed at once. The\npoor thing is in Broadmoor now. Completely unbalanced of\ncourse, but a very cleverly planned crime.\nMr Petherick came to me afterwards and brought me a\nvery nice letter from Mr Rhodes\u2014really, it made me blush.\nThen my old friend said to me: \u2018Just one thing\u2014why did you\nthink it was more likely to be Carruthers than Granby? You\u2019d\nnever seen either of them.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well,\u2019 I said. \u2018It was the g\u2019s. You said she dropped her\ng\u2019s. Now, that\u2019s done by a lot of hunting people in books,\nbut I don\u2019t know many people who do it in reality\u2014and\ncertainly no one under sixty. You said this woman was forty.\nThose dropped g\u2019s sounded to me like a woman who was\nplaying a part and over-doing it.\u2019\nI shan\u2019t tell you what Mr Petherick said to that\u2014but he\nwas very complimentary\u2014and I really couldn\u2019t help feeling\njust a teeny weeny bit pleased with myself.\nAnd it\u2019s extraordinary how things turn out for the best in\nthis world. Mr Rhodes has married again\u2014such a nice,\nsensible girl\u2014and they\u2019ve got a dear little baby and\u2014what\ndo you think?\u2014they asked me to be godmother. Wasn\u2019t it\nnice of them?\nNow I do hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been running on too\nlong\u2026\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Dressmaker\u2019s Doll\nI\nThe doll lay in the big velvet-covered chair. There was not\nmuch light in the room; the London skies were dark. In the\ngentle, greyish-green gloom, the sage-green coverings and\nthe curtains and the rugs all blended with each other. The\ndoll blended, too. She lay long and limp and sprawled in her\ngreen-velvet clothes and her velvet cap and the painted\nmask of her face. She was the Puppet Doll, the whim of Rich\nWomen, the doll who lolls beside the telephone, or among\nthe cushions of the divan. She sprawled there, eternally limp\nand yet strangely alive. She looked a decadent product of\nthe twentieth century.\nSybil Fox, hurrying in with some patterns and a sketch,\nlooked at the doll with a faint feeling of surprise and\nbewilderment. She wondered\u2014but whatever she wondered\ndid not get to the front of her mind. Instead, she thought to\nherself, \u2018Now, what\u2019s happened to the pattern of the blue\nvelvet? Wherever have I put it? I\u2019m sure I had it here just\nnow.\u2019 She went out on the landing and called up to the\nworkroom.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Elspeth, Elspeth, have you the blue pattern up there?\nMrs Fellows-Brown will be here any minute now.\u2019\nShe went in again, switching on the lights. Again she\nglanced at the doll. \u2018Now where on earth\u2014ah, there it is.\u2019\nShe picked the pattern up from where it had fallen from her\nhand. There was the usual creak outside on the landing as\nthe elevator came to a halt and in a minute or two Mrs\nFellows-Brown, accompanied by her Pekinese, came pu\ufb03ng\ninto the room rather like a fussy local train arriving at a\nwayside station.\n\u2018It\u2019s going to pour,\u2019 she said, \u2018simply pour!\u2019\nShe threw o\ufb00 her gloves and a fur. Alicia Coombe came\nin. She didn\u2019t always come in nowadays, only when special\ncustomers arrived, and Mrs Fellows-Brown was such a\ncustomer.\nElspeth, the forewoman of the workroom, came down\nwith the frock and Sybil pulled it over Mrs Fellows-Brown\u2019s\nhead.\n\u2018There,\u2019 she said, \u2018I think it\u2019s good. Yes, it\u2019s de\ufb01nitely a\nsuccess.\u2019\nMrs Fellows-Brown turned sideways and looked in the\nmirror.\n\u2018I must say,\u2019 she said, \u2018your clothes do do something to\nmy behind.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re much thinner than you were three months ago,\u2019\nSybil assured her.\n\u2018I\u2019m really not,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-Brown, \u2018though I must\nsay I look it in this. There\u2019s something about the way you\n\n----Page Break----\ncut, it really does minimize my behind. I almost look as\nthough I hadn\u2019t got one\u2014I mean only the usual kind that\nmost people have.\u2019 She sighed and gingerly smoothed the\ntroublesome portion of her anatomy. \u2018It\u2019s always been a bit\nof a trial to me,\u2019 she said. \u2018Of course, for years I could pull it\nin, you know, by sticking out my front. Well, I can\u2019t do that\nany longer because I\u2019ve got a stomach now as well as a\nbehind. And I mean\u2014well, you can\u2019t pull it in both ways, can\nyou?\u2019\nAlicia Coombe said, \u2018You should see some of my\ncustomers!\u2019\nMrs Fellows-Brown experimented to and fro.\n\u2018A stomach is worse than a behind,\u2019 she said. \u2018It shows\nmore. Or perhaps you think it does, because, I mean, when\nyou\u2019re talking to people you\u2019re facing them and that\u2019s the\nmoment they can\u2019t see your behind but they can notice\nyour stomach. Anyway, I\u2019ve made it a rule to pull in my\nstomach and let my behind look after itself.\u2019 She craned her\nneck round still farther, then said suddenly, \u2018Oh, that doll of\nyours! She gives me the creeps. How long have you had\nher?\u2019\nSybil glanced uncertainly at Alicia Coombe, who looked\npuzzled but vaguely distressed.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know exactly\u2026some time I think\u2014I never can\nremember things. It\u2019s awful nowadays\u2014I simply cannot\nremember. Sybil, how long have we had her?\u2019\nSybil said shortly, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-Brown, \u2018she gives me the creeps.\nUncanny! She looks, you know, as though she was watching\nus all, and perhaps laughing in that velvet sleeve of hers. I\u2019d\n\n----Page Break----\nget rid of her if I were you.\u2019 She gave a little shiver, then she\nplunged once more into dress-making details. Should she or\nshould she not have the sleeves an inch shorter? And what\nabout the length? When all these important points were\nsettled satisfactorily, Mrs Fellows-Brown resumed her own\ngarments and prepared to leave. As she passed the doll, she\nturned her head again.\n\u2018No,\u2019 she said, \u2018I don\u2019t like that doll. She looks too much\nas though she belonged here. It isn\u2019t healthy.\u2019\n\u2018Now what did she mean by that?\u2019 demanded Sybil, as\nMrs Fellows-Brown departed down the stairs.\nBefore Alicia Coombe could answer, Mrs Fellows-Brown\nreturned, poking her head round the door.\n\u2018Good gracious, I forgot all about Fou-Ling. Where are\nyou, ducksie? Well, I never!\u2019\nShe stared and the other two women stared, too. The\nPekinese was sitting by the green-velvet chair, staring up at\nthe limp doll sprawled on it. There was no expression, either\nof pleasure or resentment, on his small, pop-eyed face. He\nwas merely looking.\n\u2018Come along, mum\u2019s darling,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-Brown.\nMum\u2019s darling paid no attention whatever.\n\u2018He gets more disobedient every day,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-\nBrown, with the air of one cataloguing a virtue. \u2018Come on,\nFou-Ling. Dindins. Lu\ufb04y liver.\u2019\nFou-Ling turned his head about an inch and a half\ntowards his mistress, then with disdain resumed his\nappraisal of the doll.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018She\u2019s certainly made an impression on him,\u2019 said Mrs\nFellows-Brown. \u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever noticed her before. I\nhaven\u2019t either. Was she here last time I came?\u2019\nThe other two women looked at each other. Sybil now\nhad a frown on her face, and Alicia Coombe said, wrinkling\nup her forehead, \u2018I told you\u2014I simply can\u2019t remember\nanything nowadays. How long have we had her, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018Where did she come from?\u2019 demanded Mrs Fellows-\nBrown. \u2018Did you buy her?\u2019\n\u2018Oh no.\u2019 Somehow Alicia Coombe was shocked at the\nidea. \u2018Oh no. I suppose\u2014I suppose someone gave her to\nme.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018Maddening!\u2019 she exclaimed.\n\u2018Absolutely maddening, when everything goes out of your\nhead the very moment after it\u2019s happened.\u2019\n\u2018Now don\u2019t be stupid, Fou-Ling,\u2019 said Mrs Fellows-Brown\nsharply. \u2018Come on. I\u2019ll have to pick you up.\u2019\nShe picked him up. Fou-Ling uttered a short bark of\nagonized protest. They went out of the room with Fou-Ling\u2019s\npop-eyed face turned over his \ufb02u\ufb00y shoulder, still staring\nwith enormous attention at the doll on the chair\u2026\n\u2018That there doll,\u2019 said Mrs Groves, \u2018fair gives me the\ncreeps, it does.\u2019\nMrs Groves was the cleaner. She had just \ufb01nished a\ncrablike progress backwards along the \ufb02oor. Now she was\nstanding up and working slowly round the room with a\nduster.\n\u2018Funny thing,\u2019 said Mrs Groves, \u2018never noticed it really\nuntil yesterday. And then it hit me all of a sudden, as you\nmight say.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You don\u2019t like it?\u2019 asked Sybil.\n\u2018I tell you, Mrs Fox, it gives me the creeps,\u2019 said the\ncleaning woman. \u2018It ain\u2019t natural, if you know what I mean.\nAll those long hanging legs and the way she\u2019s slouched\ndown there and the cunning look she has in her eye. It\ndoesn\u2019t look healthy, that\u2019s what I say.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve never said anything about her before,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018I tell you, I never noticed her\u2014not till this morning\u2026 Of\ncourse I know she\u2019s been here some time but\u2014\u2019 She\nstopped and a puzzled expression \ufb02itted across her face.\n\u2018Sort of thing you might dream of at night,\u2019 she said, and\ngathering up various cleaning implements she departed\nfrom the \ufb01tting-room and walked across the landing to the\nroom on the other side.\nSybil stared at the relaxed doll. An expression of\nbewilderment was growing on her face. Alicia Coombe\nentered and Sybil turned sharply.\n\u2018Miss Coombe, how long have you had this creature?\u2019\n\u2018What, the doll? My dear, you know I can\u2019t remember\nthings. Yesterday\u2014why, it\u2019s too silly!\u2014I was going out to\nthat lecture and I hadn\u2019t gone halfway down the street when\nI suddenly found I couldn\u2019t remember where I was going. I\nthought and I thought. Finally I told myself it must be\nFortnums. I knew there was something I wanted to get at\nFortnums. Well, you won\u2019t believe me, it wasn\u2019t till I actually\ngot home and was having some tea that I remembered\nabout the lecture. Of course, I\u2019ve always heard that people\ngo gaga as they get on in life, but it\u2019s happening to me\nmuch too fast. I\u2019ve forgotten now where I\u2019ve put my\nhandbag\u2014and my spectacles, too. Where did I put those\n\n----Page Break----\nspectacles? I had them just now\u2014I was reading something\nin The Times.\u2019\n\u2018The spectacles are on the mantelpiece here,\u2019 said Sybil,\nhanding them to her. \u2018How did you get the doll? Who gave\nher to you?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s a blank, too,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018Somebody\ngave her to me or sent her to me, I suppose\u2026However, she\ndoes seem to match the room very well, doesn\u2019t she?\u2019\n\u2018Rather too well, I think,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018Funny thing is, I\ncan\u2019t remember when I \ufb01rst noticed her here.\u2019\n\u2018Now don\u2019t you get the same way as I am,\u2019 Alicia Coombe\nadmonished her. \u2018After all, you\u2019re young still.\u2019\n\u2018But really, Miss Coombe, I don\u2019t remember. I mean, I\nlooked at her yesterday and thought there was something\u2014\nwell, Mrs Groves is quite right\u2014something creepy about her.\nAnd then I thought I\u2019d already thought so, and then I tried to\nremember when I \ufb01rst thought so, and\u2014well, I just couldn\u2019t\nremember anything! In a way, it was as if I\u2019d never seen her\nbefore\u2014only it didn\u2019t feel like that. It felt as though she\u2019d\nbeen here a long time but I\u2019d only just noticed her.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps she \ufb02ew in through the window one day on a\nbroomstick,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018Anyway, she belongs here\nnow all right.\u2019 She looked round. \u2018You could hardly imagine\nthe room without her, could you?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Sybil, with a slight shiver, \u2018but I rather wish I\ncould.\u2019\n\u2018Could what?\u2019\n\u2018Imagine the room without her.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Are we all going barmy about this doll?\u2019 demanded Alicia\nCoombe impatiently. \u2018What\u2019s wrong with the poor thing?\nLooks like a decayed cabbage to me, but perhaps,\u2019 she\nadded, \u2018that\u2019s because I haven\u2019t got spectacles on.\u2019 She put\nthem on her nose and looked \ufb01rmly at the doll. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she\nsaid, \u2018I see what you mean. She is a little creepy\u2026Sad-\nlooking but\u2014well, sly and rather determined, too.\u2019\n\u2018Funny,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018Mrs Fellows-Brown taking such a\nviolent dislike to her.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s one who never minds speaking her mind,\u2019 said\nAlicia Coombe.\n\u2018But it\u2019s odd,\u2019 persisted Sybil, \u2018that this doll should make\nsuch an impression on her.\u2019\n\u2018Well, people do take dislikes very suddenly sometimes.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Sybil with a little laugh, \u2018that doll never\nwas here until yesterday\u2026Perhaps she just\u2014\ufb02ew in through\nthe window, as you say, and settled herself here.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said\nAlicia Coombe, \u2018I\u2019m sure she\u2019s been here some time.\nPerhaps she only became visible yesterday.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what I feel, too,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018that she\u2019s been here\nsome time\u2026but all the same I don\u2019t remember really seeing\nher till yesterday.\u2019\n\u2018Now, dear,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe briskly, \u2018do stop it. You\u2019re\nmaking me feel quite peculiar with shivers running up and\ndown my spine. You\u2019re not going to work up a great deal of\nsupernatural hoo-hah about that creature, are you?\u2019 She\npicked up the doll, shook it out, rearranged its shoulders,\nand sat it down again on another chair. Immediately the doll\n\ufb02opped slightly and relaxed.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018It\u2019s not a bit lifelike,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, staring at the\ndoll. \u2018And yet, in a funny way, she does seem alive, doesn\u2019t\nshe?\u2019\nII\n\u2018Oo, it did give me a turn,\u2019 said Mrs Groves, as she went\nround the showroom, dusting. \u2018Such a turn as I hardly like to\ngo into the \ufb01tting-room any more.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s given you a turn?\u2019 demanded Miss Coombe who\nwas sitting at a writing-table in the corner, busy with various\naccounts. \u2018This woman,\u2019 she added more for her own bene\ufb01t\nthan that of Mrs Groves, \u2018thinks she can have two evening\ndresses, three cocktail dresses, and a suit every year\nwithout ever paying me a penny for them! Really, some\npeople!\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s that doll,\u2019 said Mrs Groves.\n\u2018What, our doll again?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, sitting up there at the desk, like a human. Oo, it\ndidn\u2019t half give me a turn!\u2019\n\u2018What are you talking about?\u2019\nAlicia Coombe got up, strode across the room, across the\nlanding outside, and into the room opposite\u2014the \ufb01tting-\nroom. There was a small Sheraton desk in one corner of it,\nand there, sitting in a chair drawn up to it, her long \ufb02oppy\narms on the desk, sat the doll.\n\u2018Sombody seems to have been having fun,\u2019 said Alicia\nCoombe. \u2018Fancy sitting her up like that. Really, she looks\nquite natural.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nSybil Fox came down the stairs at this moment, carrying\na dress that was to be tried on that morning.\n\u2018Come here, Sybil. Look at our doll sitting at my private\ndesk and writing letters now.\u2019\nThe two women looked.\n\u2018Really,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018it\u2019s too ridiculous! I wonder\nwho propped her up there. Did you?\u2019\n\u2018No, I didn\u2019t,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018It must have been one of the\ngirls from upstairs.\u2019\n\u2018A silly sort of joke, really,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. She\npicked up the doll from the desk and threw her back on the\nsofa.\nSybil laid the dress over a chair carefully, then she went\nout and up the stairs to the workroom.\n\u2018You know the doll,\u2019 she said, \u2018the velvet doll in Miss\nCoombe\u2019s room downstairs\u2014in the \ufb01tting room?\u2019\nThe forewoman and three girls looked up.\n\u2018Yes, miss, of course we know.\u2019\n\u2018Who sat her up at the desk this morning for a joke?\u2019\nThe three girls looked at her, then Elspeth, the\nforewoman, said, \u2018Sat her up at the desk? I didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018Nor did I,\u2019 said one of the girls. \u2018Did you, Marlene?\u2019\nMarlene shook her head.\n\u2018This your bit of fun, Elspeth?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018No, indeed,\u2019 said Elspeth, a stern woman who looked as\nthough her mouth should always be \ufb01lled with pins. \u2018I\u2019ve\nmore to do than going about playing with dolls and sitting\nthem up at desks.\u2019\n\u2018Look here,\u2019 said Sybil, and to her surprise her voice\nshook slightly. \u2018It was\u2014it was quite a good joke, only I\u2019d just\nlike to know who did it.\u2019\nThe three girls bristled.\n\u2018We\u2019ve told you, Mrs Fox. None of us did it, did we,\nMarlene?\u2019\n\u2018I didn\u2019t,\u2019 said Marlene, \u2018and if Nellie and Margaret say\nthey didn\u2019t, well then, none of us did.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve heard what I had to say,\u2019 said Elspeth. \u2018What\u2019s\nthis all about anyway, Mrs Fox?\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps it was Mrs Groves?\u2019 said Marlene.\nSybil shook her head. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be Mrs Groves. It gave\nher quite a turn.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll come down and see for myself,\u2019 said Elspeth.\n\u2018She\u2019s not there now,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018Miss Coombe took her\naway from the desk and threw her back on the sofa. Well\u2014\u2019\nshe paused\u2014\u2018what I mean is, someone must have stuck her\nup there in the chair at the writing-desk\u2014thinking it was\nfunny. I suppose. And\u2014and I don\u2019t see why they won\u2019t say\nso.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve told you twice, Mrs Fox,\u2019 said Margaret. \u2018I don\u2019t see\nwhy you should go on accusing us of telling lies. None of us\nwould do a silly thing like that.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. But\u2014\nbut who else could possibly have done it?\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps she got up and walked there herself,\u2019 said\nMarlene, and giggled.\nFor some reason Sybil didn\u2019t like the suggestion.\n\u2018Oh, it\u2019s all a lot of nonsense, anyway,\u2019 she said, and\nwent down the stairs again.\nAlicia Coombe was humming quite cheerfully. She looked\nround the room.\n\u2018I\u2019ve lost my spectacles again,\u2019 she said, \u2018but it doesn\u2019t\nreally matter. I don\u2019t want to see anything this moment. The\ntrouble is, of course, when you\u2019re as blind as I am, that\nwhen you have lost your spectacles, unless you\u2019ve got\nanother pair to put on and \ufb01nd them with, well, then you\ncan\u2019t \ufb01nd them because you can\u2019t see to \ufb01nd them.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll look round for you,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018You had them just\nnow.\u2019\n\u2018I went into the other room when you went upstairs. I\nexpect I took them back in there.\u2019\nShe went across to the other room.\n\u2018It\u2019s such a bother,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018I want to get on\nwith these accounts. How can I if I haven\u2019t my spectacles?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll go up and get your second pair from the bedroom,\u2019\nsaid Sybil.\n\u2018I haven\u2019t a second pair at present,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\n\u2018Why, what\u2019s happened to them?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, I think I left them yesterday when I was out at\nlunch. I\u2019ve rung up there, and I\u2019ve rung up the two shops I\nwent into, too.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, dear,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018you\u2019ll have to get three pairs, I\nsuppose.\u2019\n\u2018If I had three pairs of spectacles,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018I\nshould spend my whole life looking for one or the other of\nthem. I really think it\u2019s best to have only one. Then you\u2019ve\ngot to look till you \ufb01nd it.\u2019\n\u2018Well, they must be somewhere,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018You haven\u2019t\nbeen out of these two rooms. They\u2019re certainly not here, so\nyou must have laid them down in the \ufb01tting-room.\u2019\nShe went back, walking round, looking quite closely.\nFinally, as a last idea, she took up the doll from the sofa.\n\u2018I\u2019ve got them,\u2019 she called.\n\u2018Oh, where were they, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018Under our precious doll. I suppose you must have thrown\nthem down when you put her back on the sofa.\u2019\n\u2018I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 said Sybil with exasperation. \u2018Then I suppose the\ndoll took them and was hiding them from you!\u2019\n\u2018Really, you know,\u2019 said Alicia, looking thoughtfully at the\ndoll, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t put it past her. She looks very intelligent,\ndon\u2019t you think, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think I like her face,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018She looks as\nthough she knew something that we didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You don\u2019t think she looks sort of sad and sweet?\u2019 said\nAlicia Coombe pleadingly, but without conviction.\n\u2018I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in the least sweet,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018No\u2026perhaps you\u2019re right\u2026Oh, well, let\u2019s get on with\nthings. Lady Lee will be here in another ten minutes. I just\nwant to get these invoices done and posted.\u2019\nIII\n\u2018Mrs Fox. Mrs Fox?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, Margaret?\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018What is it?\u2019\nSybil was busy leaning over a table, cutting a piece of\nsatin material.\n\u2018Oh, Mrs Fox, it\u2019s that doll again. I took down the brown\ndress like you said, and there\u2019s that doll sitting up at the\ndesk again. And it wasn\u2019t me\u2014it wasn\u2019t any of us. Please,\nMrs Fox, we really wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u2019\nSybil\u2019s scissors slid a little.\n\u2018There,\u2019 she said angrily, \u2018look what you\u2019ve made me do.\nOh, well, it\u2019ll be all right, I suppose. Now, what\u2019s this about\nthe doll?\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s sitting at the desk again.\u2019\nSybil went down and walked into the \ufb01tting-room. The\ndoll was sitting at the desk exactly as she had sat there\nbefore.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018You\u2019re very determined, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 said Sybil, speaking\nto the doll.\nShe picked her up unceremoniously and put her back on\nthe sofa.\n\u2018That\u2019s your place, my girl,\u2019 she said. \u2018You stay there.\u2019\nShe walked across to the other room.\n\u2018Miss Coombe.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018Somebody is having a game with us, you know. That doll\nwas sitting at the desk again.\u2019\n\u2018Who do you think it is?\u2019\n\u2018It must be one of those three upstairs,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018Thinks it\u2019s funny, I suppose. Of course they all swear to\nhigh heaven it wasn\u2019t them.\u2019\n\u2018Who do you think it is\u2014Margaret?\u2019\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Margaret. She looked quite queer\nwhen she came in and told me. I expect it\u2019s that giggling\nMarlene.\u2019\n\u2018Anyway, it\u2019s a very silly thing to do.\u2019\n\u2018Of course it is\u2014idiotic,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018However,\u2019 she added\ngrimly, \u2018I\u2019m going to put a stop to it.\u2019\n\u2018What are you going to do?\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll see,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\n----Page Break----\nThat night when she left, she locked the \ufb01tting-room from\nthe outside.\n\u2018I\u2019m locking this door,\u2019 she said, \u2018and I\u2019m taking the key\nwith me.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, I see,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, with a faint air of\namusement. \u2018You\u2019re beginning to think it\u2019s me, are you? You\nthink I\u2019m so absent-minded that I go in there and think I\u2019ll\nwrite at the desk, but instead I pick the doll up and put her\nthere to write for me. Is that the idea? And then I forget all\nabout it?\u2019\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s a possibility,\u2019 Sybil admitted. \u2018Anyway, I\u2019m\ngoing to be quite sure that no silly practical joke is played\ntonight.\u2019\nThe following morning, her lips set grimly, the \ufb01rst thing\nSybil did on arrival was to unlock the door of the \ufb01tting-\nroom and march in. Mrs Groves, with an aggrieved\nexpression and mop and duster in hand, had been waiting\non the landing.\n\u2018Now we\u2019ll see!\u2019 said Sybil.\nThen she drew back with a slight gasp.\nThe doll was sitting at the desk.\n\u2018Coo!\u2019 said Mrs Groves behind her. \u2018It\u2019s uncanny! That\u2019s\nwhat it is. Oh, there, Mrs Fox, you look quite pale, as though\nyou\u2019ve come over queer. You need a little drop of\nsomething. Has Miss Coombe got a drop upstairs, do you\nknow?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m quite all right,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\n----Page Break----\nShe walked over to the doll, lifted her carefully, and\ncrossed the room with her.\n\u2018Somebody\u2019s been playing a trick on you again,\u2019 said Mrs\nGroves.\n\u2018I don\u2019t see how they could have played a trick on me\nthis time,\u2019 said Sybil slowly. \u2018I locked that door last night. You\nknow yourself that no one could get in.\u2019\n\u2018Somebody\u2019s got another key, maybe,\u2019 said Mrs Groves\nhelpfully.\n\u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018We\u2019ve never bothered to\nlock this door before. It\u2019s one of those old-fashioned keys\nand there\u2019s only one of them.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps the other key \ufb01ts it\u2014the one to the door\nopposite.\u2019\nIn due course they tried all the keys in the shop, but\nnone \ufb01tted the door of the \ufb01tting-room.\n\u2018It is odd, Miss Coombe,\u2019 said Sybil later, as they were\nhaving lunch together.\nAlicia Coombe was looking rather pleased.\n\u2018My dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018I think it\u2019s simply extraordinary. I\nthink we ought to write to the psychical research people\nabout it. You know, they might send an investigator\u2014a\nmedium or someone\u2014to see if there\u2019s anything peculiar\nabout the room.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t seem to mind at all,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, I rather enjoy it in a way,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018I\nmean, at my age, it\u2019s rather fun when things happen! All the\nsame\u2014no,\u2019 she added thoughtfully. \u2018I don\u2019t think I do quite\nlike it. I mean, that doll\u2019s getting rather above herself, isn\u2019t\nshe?\u2019\nOn that evening Sybil and Alicia Coombe locked the door\nonce more on the outside.\n\u2018I still think,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018that somebody might be playing\na practical joke, though, really, I don\u2019t see why\u2026\u2019\n\u2018Do you think she\u2019ll be at the desk again tomorrow\nmorning?\u2019 demanded Alicia.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018I do.\u2019\nBut they were wrong. The doll was not at the desk.\nInstead, she was on the window sill, looking out into the\nstreet. And again there was an extraordinary naturalness\nabout her position.\n\u2018It\u2019s all frightfully silly, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, as\nthey were snatching a quick cup of tea that afternoon. By\ncommon consent they were not having it in the \ufb01tting-room,\nas they usually did, but in Alicia Coombe\u2019s own room\nopposite.\n\u2018Silly in what way?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I mean, there\u2019s nothing you can get hold of. Just a\ndoll that\u2019s always in a di\ufb00erent place.\u2019\nAs day followed day it seemed a more and more apt\nobservation. It was not only at night that the doll now\nmoved. At any moment when they came into the \ufb01tting-\nroom, after they had been absent even a few minutes, they\n\n----Page Break----\nmight \ufb01nd the doll in a di\ufb00erent place. They could have left\nher on the sofa and \ufb01nd her on a chair. Then she\u2019d be on a\ndi\ufb00erent chair. Sometimes she\u2019d be in the window seat,\nsometimes at the desk again.\n\u2018She just moves about as she likes,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\n\u2018And I think, Sybil, I think it\u2019s amusing her.\u2019\nThe two women stood looking down at the inert\nsprawling \ufb01gure in its limp, soft velvet, with its painted silk\nface.\n\u2018Some old bits of velvet and silk and a lick of paint, that\u2019s\nall it is,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. Her voice was strained. \u2018I\nsuppose, you know, we could\u2014er\u2014we could dispose of her.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean, dispose of her?\u2019 asked Sybil. Her\nvoice sounded almost shocked.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018we could put her in the \ufb01re, if\nthere was a \ufb01re. Burn her, I mean, like a witch\u2026Or of\ncourse,\u2019 she added matter-of-factly, \u2018we could just put her in\nthe dustbin.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think that would do,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018Somebody would\nprobably take her out of the dustbin and bring her back to\nus.\u2019\n\u2018Or we could send her somewhere,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\n\u2018You know, to one of those societies who are always writing\nand asking for something\u2014for a sale or a bazaar. I think\nthat\u2019s the best idea.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018I\u2019d be almost afraid to do\nthat.\u2019\n\u2018Afraid?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well, I think she\u2019d come back,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018You mean, she\u2019d come back here?\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Like a homing pigeon?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, that\u2019s what I mean.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose we\u2019re not going o\ufb00 our heads, are we?\u2019 said\nAlicia Coombe. \u2018Perhaps I\u2019ve really gone gaga and perhaps\nyou\u2019re just humouring me, is that it?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018But I\u2019ve got a nasty frightening feeling\u2014\na horrid feeling that she\u2019s too strong for us.\u2019\n\u2018What? That mess of rags?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, that horrible limp mess of rags. Because, you see,\nshe\u2019s so determined.\u2019\n\u2018Determined?\u2019\n\u2018To have her own way! I mean, this is her room now!\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, looking round, \u2018it is, isn\u2019t it? Of\ncourse, it always was, when you come to think of it\u2014the\ncolours and everything\u2026I thought she \ufb01tted in here, but it\u2019s\nthe room that \ufb01ts her. I must say,\u2019 added the dressmaker,\nwith a touch of briskness in her voice, \u2018it\u2019s rather absurd\nwhen a doll comes and takes possession of things like this.\nYou know, Mrs Groves won\u2019t come in here any longer and\nclean.\u2019\n\u2018Does she say she\u2019s frightened of the doll?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018No. She just makes excuses of some kind or other.\u2019 Then\nAlicia added with a hint of panic, \u2018What are we going to do,\nSybil? It\u2019s getting me down, you know. I haven\u2019t been able\nto design anything for weeks.\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t keep my mind on cutting out properly,\u2019 Sybil\nconfessed. \u2018I make all sorts of silly mistakes. Perhaps,\u2019 she\nsaid uncertainly, \u2018your idea of writing to the psychical\nresearch people might do some good.\u2019\n\u2018Just make us look like a couple of fools,\u2019 said Alicia\nCoombe. \u2018I didn\u2019t seriously mean it. No, I suppose we\u2019ll just\nhave to go on until\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Until what?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Alicia, and she laughed\nuncertainly.\nOn the following day Sybil, when she arrived, found the\ndoor of the \ufb01tting-room locked.\n\u2018Miss Coombe, have you got the key? Did you lock this\nlast night?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018I locked it and it\u2019s going to\nstay locked.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\u2018I just mean I\u2019ve given up the room. The doll can have it.\nWe don\u2019t need two rooms. We can \ufb01t in here.\u2019\n\u2018But it\u2019s your own private sitting-room.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I don\u2019t want it any more. I\u2019ve got a very nice\nbedroom. I can make a bed-sitting room out of that, can\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Do you mean you\u2019re really not going into that \ufb01tting-\nroom ever again?\u2019 said Sybil incredulously.\n\u2018That\u2019s exactly what I mean.\u2019\n\u2018But\u2014what about cleaning? It\u2019ll get in a terrible state.\u2019\n\u2018Let it!\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018If this place is su\ufb00ering from\nsome kind of possession by a doll, all right\u2014let her keep\npossession. And clean the room herself.\u2019 And she added,\n\u2018She hates us, you know.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018The doll hates us?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Alicia. \u2018Didn\u2019t you know? You must have\nknown. You must have seen it when you looked at her.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Sybil thoughtfully, \u2018I suppose I did. I suppose I\nfelt that all along\u2014that she hated us and wanted to get us\nout of there.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s a malicious little thing,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\n\u2018Anyway, she ought to be satis\ufb01ed now.\u2019\nThings went on rather more peacefully after that. Alicia\nCoombe announced to her sta\ufb00 that she was giving up the\nuse of the \ufb01tting-room for the present\u2014it made too many\nrooms to dust and clean, she explained.\nBut it hardly helped her to overhear one of the work girls\nsaying to another on the evening of the same day, \u2018She\nreally is batty, Miss Coombe is now. I always thought she\nwas a bit queer\u2014the way she lost things and forgot things.\nBut it\u2019s really beyond anything now, isn\u2019t it? She\u2019s got a sort\nof thing about that doll downstairs.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Ooo, you don\u2019t think she\u2019ll go really bats, do you?\u2019 said\nthe other girl. \u2018That she might knife us or something?\u2019\nThey passed, chattering, and Alicia sat up indignantly in\nher chair. Going bats indeed! Then she added ruefully, to\nherself, \u2018I suppose, if it wasn\u2019t for Sybil, I should think myself\nthat I was going bats. But with me and Sybil and Mrs Groves\ntoo, well, it does look as though there was something in it.\nBut what I don\u2019t see is, how is it going to end?\u2019\nThree weeks later, Sybil said to Alicia Coombe, \u2018We\u2019ve\ngot to go into that room sometimes.\u2019\n\u2018Why?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I mean, it must be in a \ufb01lthy state. Moths will be\ngetting into things, and all that. We ought just to dust and\nsweep it and then lock it up again.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d much rather keep it shut up and not go back in\nthere,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe.\nSybil said, \u2018Really, you know, you\u2019re even more\nsuperstitious than I am.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose I am,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018I was much more\nready to believe in all this than you were, but to begin with,\nyou know\u2014I\u2014well, I found it exciting in an odd sort of way. I\ndon\u2019t know. I\u2019m just scared, and I\u2019d rather not go into that\nroom again.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I want to,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018and I\u2019m going to.\u2019\n\u2018You know what\u2019s the matter with you?\u2019 said Alicia\nCoombe. \u2018You\u2019re simply curious, that\u2019s all.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018All right, then I\u2019m curious. I want to see what the doll\u2019s\ndone.\u2019\n\u2018I still think it\u2019s much better to leave her alone,\u2019 said\nAlicia. \u2018Now we\u2019ve got out of that room, she\u2019s satis\ufb01ed.\nYou\u2019d better leave her satisi\ufb01ed.\u2019 She gave an exasperated\nsigh. \u2018What nonsense we are talking!\u2019\n\u2018Yes. I know we\u2019re talking nonsense, but if you tell me of\nany way of not talking nonsense\u2014come on, now, give me\nthe key.\u2019\n\u2018All right, all right.\u2019\n\u2018I believe you\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll let her out or something. I\nshould think she was the kind that could pass through doors\nor windows.\u2019\nSybil unlocked the door and went in.\n\u2018How terribly odd,\u2019 she said.\n\u2018What\u2019s odd?\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, peering over her\nshoulder.\n\u2018The room hardly seems dusty at all, does it? You\u2019d think,\nafter being shut up all this time\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Yes, it is odd.\u2019\n\u2018There she is,\u2019 said Sybil.\nThe doll was on the sofa. She was not lying in her usual\nlimp position. She was sitting upright, a cushion behind her\nback. She had the air of the mistress of the house, waiting\nto receive people.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018she seems at home all right,\ndoesn\u2019t she? I almost feel I ought to apologize for coming\nin.\u2019\n\u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 said Sybil.\nShe backed out, pulling the door to, and locked it again.\nThe two women gazed at each other.\n\u2018I wish I knew,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe, \u2018why it scares us so\nmuch\u2026\u2019\n\u2018My goodness, who wouldn\u2019t be scared?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I mean, what happens, after all? It\u2019s nothing really\n\u2014just a kind of puppet that gets moved around the room. I\nexpect it isn\u2019t the puppet itself\u2014it\u2019s a poltergeist.\u2019\n\u2018Now that is a good idea.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, but I don\u2019t really believe it. I think it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s that doll.\u2019\n\u2018Are you sure you don\u2019t know where she really came\nfrom?\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t the faintest idea,\u2019 said Alicia. \u2018And the more I\nthink of it the more I\u2019m perfectly certain that I didn\u2019t buy\nher, and that nobody gave her to me. I think she\u2014well, she\njust came.\u2019\n\u2018Do you think she\u2019ll\u2014ever go?\u2019\n\u2018Really,\u2019 said Alicia, \u2018I don\u2019t see why she should\u2026She\u2019s\ngot all she wants.\u2019\nBut it seemed that the doll had not got all she wanted.\nThe next day, when Sybil went into the showroom, she drew\n\n----Page Break----\nin her breath with a sudden gasp. Then she called up the\nstairs.\n\u2018Miss Coombe, Miss Coombe, come down here.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019\nAlicia Coombe, who had got up late, came down the\nstairs, hobbling a little precariously for she had rheumatism\nin her right knee.\n\u2018What is the matter with you, Sybil?\u2019\n\u2018Look. Look what\u2019s happened now.\u2019\nThey stood in the doorway of the showroom. Sitting on a\nsofa, sprawled easily over the arm of it, was the doll.\n\u2018She\u2019s got out,\u2019 said Sybil, \u2018She\u2019s got out of that room!\nShe wants this room as well.\u2019\nAlicia Coombe sat down by the door. \u2018In the end,\u2019 she\nsaid, \u2018I suppose she\u2019ll want the whole shop.\u2019\n\u2018She might,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018You nasty, sly, malicious brute,\u2019 said Alicia, addressing\nthe doll. \u2018Why do you want to come and pester us so? We\ndon\u2019t want you.\u2019\nIt seemed to her, and to Sybil too, that the doll moved\nvery slightly. It was as though its limbs relaxed still further. A\nlong limp arm was lying on the arm of the sofa and the half-\nhidden face looked as if it were peering from under the arm.\nAnd it was a sly, malicious look.\n\u2018Horrible creature,\u2019 said Alicia. \u2018I can\u2019t bear it! I can\u2019t bear\nit any longer.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nSuddenly, taking Sybil completely by surprise, she\ndashed across the room, picked up the doll, ran to the\nwindow, opened it, and \ufb02ung the doll out into the street.\nThere was a gasp and a half cry of fear from Sybil.\n\u2018Oh, Alicia, you shouldn\u2019t have done that! I\u2019m sure you\nshouldn\u2019t have done that!\u2019\n\u2018I had to do something,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018I just\ncouldn\u2019t stand it any more.\u2019\nSybil joined her at the window. Down below on the\npavement the doll lay, loose-limbed, face down.\n\u2018You\u2019ve killed her,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018Don\u2019t be absurd\u2026How can I kill something that\u2019s made\nof velvet and silk, bits and pieces. It\u2019s not real.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s horribly real,\u2019 said Sybil.\nAlicia caught her breath.\n\u2018Good heavens. That child\u2014\u2019\nA small ragged girl was standing over the doll on the\npavement. She looked up and down the street\u2014a street that\nwas not unduly crowded at this time of the morning though\nthere was some automobile tra\ufb03c; then, as though\nsatis\ufb01ed, the child bent, picked up the doll, and ran across\nthe street.\n\u2018Stop, stop!\u2019 called Alicia.\nShe turned to Sybil.\n\u2018That child mustn\u2019t take the doll. She mustn\u2019t! That doll is\ndangerous\u2014it\u2019s evil. We\u2019ve got to stop her.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nIt was not they who stopped her. It was the tra\ufb03c. At that\nmoment three taxis came down one way and two\ntradesmen\u2019s vans in the other direction. The child was\nmarooned on an island in the middle of the road. Sybil\nrushed down the stairs, Alicia Coombe following her.\nDodging between a tradesman\u2019s van and a private car,\nSybil, with Alicia Coombe directly behind her, arrived on the\nisland before the child could get through the tra\ufb03c on the\nopposite side.\n\u2018You can\u2019t take that doll,\u2019 said Alicia Coombe. \u2018Give her\nback to me.\u2019\nThe child looked at her. She was a skinny little girl about\neight years old, with a slight squint. Her face was de\ufb01ant.\n\u2018Why should I give \u2019er to you?\u2019 she said. \u2018Pitched her out\nof the window, you did\u2014I saw you. If you pushed her out of\nthe window you don\u2019t want her, so now she\u2019s mine.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll buy you another doll,\u2019 said Alicia frantically. \u2018We\u2019ll go\nto a toy shop\u2014anywhere you like\u2014and I\u2019ll buy you the best\ndoll we can \ufb01nd. But give me back this one.\u2019\n\u2018Shan\u2019t,\u2019 said the child.\nHer arms went protectingly round the velvet doll.\n\u2018You must give her back,\u2019 said Sybil. \u2018She isn\u2019t yours.\u2019\nShe stretched out to take the doll from the child and at\nthat moment the child stamped her foot, turned, and\nscreamed at them.\n\u2018Shan\u2019t! Shan\u2019t! Shan\u2019t! She\u2019s my very own. I love her.\nYou don\u2019t love her. You hate her. If you didn\u2019t hate her you\n\n----Page Break----\nwouldn\u2019t have pushed her out of the window. I love her, I tell\nyou, and that\u2019s what she wants. She wants to be loved.\u2019\nAnd then like an eel, sliding through the vehicles, the\nchild ran across the street, down an alleyway, and out of\nsight before the two older women could decide to dodge the\ncars and follow.\n\u2018She\u2019s gone,\u2019 said Alicia.\n\u2018She said the doll wanted to be loved,\u2019 said Sybil.\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Alicia, \u2018perhaps that\u2019s what she wanted all\nalong\u2026to be loved\u2026\u2019\nIn the middle of the London tra\ufb03c the two frightened\nwomen stared at each other.\n\n----Page Break----\nIn A Glass Darkly\n\u2018I\u2019ve no explanation of this story. I\u2019ve no theories about the\nwhy and wherefore of it. It\u2019s just a thing\u2014that happened.\nAll the same, I sometimes wonder how things would have\ngone if I\u2019d noticed at the time just that one essential detail\nthat I never appreciated until so many years afterwards. If I\nhad noticed it\u2014well, I suppose the course of three lives\nwould have been entirely altered. Somehow\u2014that\u2019s a very\nfrightening thought.\nFor the beginning of it all, I\u2019ve got to go back to the\nsummer of 1914\u2014just before the war\u2014when I went down to\nBadgeworthy with Neil Carslake. Neil was, I suppose, about\nmy best friend. I\u2019d known his brother Alan too, but not so\nwell. Sylvia, their sister, I\u2019d never met. She was two years\nyounger than Alan and three years younger than Neil. Twice,\nwhile we were at school together, I\u2019d been going to spend\npart of the holidays with Neil at Badgeworthy and twice\nsomething had intervened. So it came about that I was\ntwenty-three when I \ufb01rst saw Neil and Alan\u2019s home.\nWe were to be quite a big party there. Neil\u2019s sister Sylvia\nhad just got engaged to a fellow called Charles Crawley. He\n\n----Page Break----\nwas, so Neil said, a good deal older than she was, but a\nthoroughly decent chap and quite reasonably well-o\ufb00.\nWe arrived, I remember, about seven o\u2019clock in the\nevening. Everyone had gone to his room to dress for dinner.\nNeil took me to mine. Badgeworthy was an attractive,\nrambling old house. It had been added to freely in the last\nthree centuries and was full of little steps up and down, and\nunexpected staircases. It was the sort of house in which it\u2019s\nnot easy to \ufb01nd your way about. I remember Neil promised\nto come and fetch me on his way down to dinner. I was\nfeeling a little shy at the prospect of meeting his people for\nthe \ufb01rst time. I remember saying with a laugh that it was\nthe kind of house one expected to meet ghosts in the\npassages, and he said carelessly that he believed the place\nwas said to be haunted but that none of them had ever seen\nanything, and he didn\u2019t even know what form the ghost was\nsupposed to take.\nThen he hurried away and I set to work to dive into my\nsuitcases for my evening clothes. The Carslakes weren\u2019t\nwell-o\ufb00; they clung on to their old home, but there were no\nmenservants to unpack for you or valet you.\nWell, I\u2019d just got to the stage of tying my tie. I was\nstanding in front of the glass. I could see my own face and\nshoulders and behind them the wall of the room\u2014a plain\nstretch of wall just broken in the middle by a door\u2014and just\nas I \ufb01nally settled my tie I noticed that the door was\nopening.\nI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t turn around\u2014I think that would\nhave been the natural thing to do; anyway, I didn\u2019t. I just\nwatched the door swing slowly open\u2014and as it swung I saw\ninto the room beyond.\n\n----Page Break----\nIt was a bedroom\u2014a larger room than mine\u2014with two\nbedsteads in it, and suddenly I caught my breath.\nFor at the foot of one of those beds was a girl and round\nher neck were a pair of man\u2019s hands and the man was\nslowly forcing her backwards and squeezing her throat as he\ndid so, so that the girl was being slowly su\ufb00ocated.\nThere wasn\u2019t the least possibility of a mistake. What I\nsaw was perfectly clear. What was being done was murder.\nI could see the girl\u2019s face clearly, her vivid golden hair,\nthe agonized terror of her beautiful face, slowly su\ufb00using\nwith blood. Of the man I could see his back, his hands, and a\nscar that ran down the left side of his face towards his neck.\nIt\u2019s taken some time to tell, but in reality only a moment\nor two passed while I stared dumbfounded. Then I wheeled\nround to the rescue\u2026\nAnd on the wall behind me, the wall re\ufb02ected in the\nglass, there was only a Victorian mahogany wardrobe. No\ndoor open\u2014no scene of violence. I swung back to the mirror.\nThe mirror re\ufb02ected only the wardrobe\u2026\nI passed my hands across my eyes. Then I sprang across\nthe room and tried to pull forward the wardrobe and at that\nmoment Neil entered by the other door from the passage\nand asked me what the hell I was trying to do.\nHe must have thought me slightly barmy as I turned on\nhim and demanded whether there was a door behind the\nwardrobe. He said, yes, there was a door, it led into the next\nroom. I asked him who was occupying the next room and he\nsaid people called Oldam\u2014a Major Oldam and his wife. I\nasked him then if Mrs Oldam had very fair hair and when he\nreplied dryly that she was dark I began to realize that I was\n\n----Page Break----\nprobably making a fool of myself. I pulled myself together,\nmade some lame explanation and we went downstairs\ntogether. I told myself that I must have had some kind of\nhallucination\u2014and felt generally rather ashamed and a bit\nof an ass.\nAnd then\u2014and then\u2014Neil said, \u2018My sister Sylvia,\u2019 and I\nwas looking into the lovely face of the girl I had just seen\nbeing su\ufb00ocated to death\u2026and I was introduced to her\n\ufb01anc\u00e9, a tall dark man with a scar down the left side of his\nface.\nWell\u2014that\u2019s that. I\u2019d like you to think and say what you\u2019d\nhave done in my place. Here was the girl\u2014the identical girl\n\u2014and here was the man I\u2019d seen throttling her\u2014and they\nwere to be married in about a month\u2019s time\u2026\nHad I\u2014or had I not\u2014had a prophetic vision of the future?\nWould Sylvia and her husband come down here to stay\nsome time in the future, and be given that room (the best\nspare room) and would that scene I\u2019d witnessed take place\nin grim reality?\nWhat was I to do about it? Could I do anything? Would\nanyone\u2014Neil\u2014or the girl herself\u2014would they believe me?\nI turned the whole business over and over in my mind\nthe week I was down there. To speak or not to speak? And\nalmost at once another complication set in. You see, I fell in\nlove with Sylvia Carslake the \ufb01rst moment I saw here\u2026I\nwanted her more than anything on earth\u2026And in a way that\ntied my hands.\nAnd yet, if I didn\u2019t say anything, Sylvia would marry\nCharles Crawley and Crawley would kill her\u2026\n\n----Page Break----\nAnd so, the day before I left, I blurted it all out to her. I\nsaid I expect she\u2019d think me touched in the intellect or\nsomething, but I swore solemnly that I\u2019d seen the thing just\nas I told it to her and that I felt if she was determined to\nmarry Crawley, I ought to tell her my strange experience.\nShe listened very quietly. There was something in her\neyes I didn\u2019t understand. She wasn\u2019t angry at all. When I\u2019d\n\ufb01nished, she just thanked me gravely. I kept repeating like\nan idiot, \u2018I did see it. I really did see it,\u2019 and she said, \u2018I\u2019m\nsure you did if you say so. I believe you.\u2019\nWell, the upshot was that I went o\ufb00 not knowing whether\nI\u2019d done right or been a fool, and a week later Sylvia broke\no\ufb00 her engagement to Charles Crawley.\nAfter that the war happened, and there wasn\u2019t much\nleisure for thinking of anything else. Once or twice when I\nwas on leave, I came across Sylvia, but as far as possible I\navoided her.\nI loved her and wanted her just as badly as ever, but I\nfelt somehow that it wouldn\u2019t be playing the game. It was\nowing to me that she\u2019d broken o\ufb00 her engagement to\nCrawley, and I kept saying to myself that I could only justify\nthe action I had taken by making my attitude a purely\ndisinterested one.\nThen, in 1916, Neil was killed and it fell to me to tell\nSylvia about his last moments. We couldn\u2019t remain on\nformal footing after that. Sylvia had adored Neil and he had\nbeen my best friend. She was sweet\u2014adorably sweet in her\ngrief. I just managed to hold my tongue and went out again\npraying that a bullet might end the whole miserable\nbusiness. Life without Sylvia wasn\u2019t worth living.\n\n----Page Break----\nBut there was no bullet with my name on it. One nearly\ngot me below the right ear and one was de\ufb02ected by a\ncigarette case in my pocket, but I came through unscathed.\nCharles Crawley was killed in action at the beginning of\n1918.\nSomehow that made a di\ufb00erence. I came home in the\nautumn of 1918 just before the Armistice and I went straight\nto Sylvia and told her that I loved her. I hadn\u2019t much hope\nthat she\u2019d care for me straight away, and you could have\nknocked me down with a feather when she asked me why I\nhadn\u2019t told her sooner. I stammered out something about\nCrawley and she said, \u2018But why did you think I broke it o\ufb00\nwith him?\u2019 and then she told me that she\u2019d fallen in love\nwith me just as I\u2019d done with her\u2014from the very \ufb01rst\nminute.\nI said I thought she\u2019d broken o\ufb00 her engagement\nbecause of the story I told her and she laughed scornfully\nand said that if you loved a man you wouldn\u2019t be as\ncowardly as that, and we went over that old vision of mine\nagain and agreed that it was queer, but nothing more.\n\u2018Well, there\u2019s nothing much to tell for some time after\nthat. Sylvia and I were married and we were very happy. But\nI realized, as soon as she was really mine, that I wasn\u2019t cut\nout for the best kind of husband. I loved Sylvia devotedly,\nbut I was jealous, absurdly jealous of anyone she so much\nas smiled at. It amused her at \ufb01rst, I think she even rather\nliked it. It proved, at least, how devoted I was.\nAs for me, I realized quite fully and unmistakably that I\nwas not only making a fool of myself, but that I was\nendangering all the peace and happiness of our life\ntogether. I knew, I say, but I couldn\u2019t change. Every time\nSylvia got a letter she didn\u2019t show to me I wondered who it\n\n----Page Break----\nwas from. If she laughed and talked with any man, I found\nmyself getting sulky and watchful.\nAt \ufb01rst, as I say, Sylvia laughed at me. She thought it a\nhuge joke. Then she didn\u2019t think the joke so funny. Finally\nshe didn\u2019t think it a joke at all\u2014\nAnd slowly, she began to draw away from me. Not in any\nphysical sense, but she withdrew her secret mind from me. I\nno longer knew what her thoughts were. She was kind\u2014but\nsadly, as thought from a long distance.\nLittle by little I realized that she no longer loved me. Her\nlove had died and it was I who had killed it\u2026\nThe next step was inevitable, I found myself waiting for it\n\u2014dreading it\u2026\nThen Derek Wainwright came into our lives. He had\neverything that I hadn\u2019t. He had brains and a witty tongue.\nHe was good-looking, too, and\u2014I\u2019m forced to admit it\u2014a\nthoroughly good chap. As soon as I saw him I said to myself,\n\u2018This is just the man for Sylvia\u2026\u2019\nShe fought against it. I know she struggled\u2026but I gave\nher no help. I couldn\u2019t. I was entrenched in my gloomy,\nsullen reserve. I was su\ufb00ering like hell\u2014and I couldn\u2019t\nstretch out a \ufb01nger to save myself. I didn\u2019t help her. I made\nthings worse. I let loose at her one day\u2014a string of savage,\nunwarranted abuse. I was nearly mad with jealousy and\nmisery. The things I said were cruel and untrue and I knew\nwhile I was saying them how cruel and how untrue they\nwere. And yet I took a savage pleasure in saying them\u2026\nI remember how Sylvia \ufb02ushed and shrank\u2026\nI drove her to the edge of endurance.\n\n----Page Break----\nI remember she said, \u2018This can\u2019t go on\u2026\u2019\nWhen I came home that night the house was empty\u2014\nempty. There was a note\u2014quite in the traditional fashion.\nIn it she said that she was leaving me\u2014for good. She was\ngoing down to Badgeworthy for a day or two. After that she\nwas going to the one person who loved her and needed her.\nI was to take that as \ufb01nal.\nI suppose that up to then I hadn\u2019t really believed my own\nsuspicions. This con\ufb01rmation in black and white of my worst\nfears sent me raving mad. I went down to Badgeworthy\nafter her as fast as the car would take me.\nShe had just changed her frock for dinner, I remember,\nwhen I burst into the room. I can see her face\u2014startled\u2014\nbeautiful\u2014afraid.\nI said, \u2018No one but me shall ever have you. No one.\u2019\nAnd I caught her throat in my hands and gripped it and\nbent her backwards.\nSuddenly I saw our re\ufb02ection in the mirror. Sylvia choking\nand myself strangling her, and the scar on my cheek where\nthe bullet grazed it under the right ear.\nNo\u2014I didn\u2019t kill her. That sudden revelation paralysed me\nand I loosened my grasp and let her slip on to the \ufb02oor\u2026\nAnd then I broke down\u2014and she comforted me\u2026Yes, she\ncomforted me.\nI told her everything and she told me that by the phrase\n\u2018the one person who loved and needed her\u2019 she had meant\nher brother Alan\u2026We saw into each other\u2019s hearts that\n\n----Page Break----\nnight, and I don\u2019t think, from that moment, that we ever\ndrifted away from each other again\u2026\nIt\u2019s a sobering thought to go through life with\u2014that, but\nfor the grace of God and a mirror, one might be a\nmurderer\u2026\nOne thing did die that night\u2014the devil of jealousy that\nhad possessed me so long\u2026\nBut I wonder sometimes\u2014suppose I hadn\u2019t made that\ninitial mistake\u2014the scar on the left cheek\u2014when really it\nwas the right\u2014reversed by the mirror\u2026Should I have been\nso sure the man was Charles Crawley? Would I have warned\nSylvia? Would she be married to me\u2014or to him?\nOr are the past and the future all one?\nI\u2019m a simple fellow\u2014and I can\u2019t pretend to understand\nthese things\u2014but I saw what I saw\u2014and because of what I\nsaw, Sylvia and I are together in the old-fashioned words\u2014\ntill death do us part. And perhaps beyond\u2026\n\n----Page Break----\nGreenshaw\u2019s Folly\nI\nThe two men rounded the corner of the shrubbery.\n\u2018Well, there you are,\u2019 said Raymond West. \u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019\nHorace Bindler took a deep, appreciative breath.\n\u2018But my dear,\u2019 he cried, \u2018how wonderful.\u2019 His voice rose in\na high screech of \u00e6sthetic delight, then deepened in\nreverent awe. \u2018It\u2019s unbelievable. Out of this world! A period\npiece of the best.\u2019\n\u2018I \nthought \nyou\u2019d \nlike \nit,\u2019 \nsaid \nRaymond \nWest,\ncomplacently.\n\u2018Like it? My dear\u2014\u2019 Words failed Horace. He unbuckled\nthe strap of his camera and got busy. \u2018This will be one of the\ngems of my collection,\u2019 he said happily. \u2018I do think, don\u2019t\nyou, that it\u2019s rather amusing to have a collection of\nmonstrosities? The idea came to me one night seven years\nago in my bath. My last real gem was in the Campo Santo at\nGenoa, but I really think this beats it. What\u2019s it called?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I haven\u2019t the least idea,\u2019 said Raymond.\n\u2018I suppose it\u2019s got a name?\u2019\n\u2018It must have. But the fact is that it\u2019s never referred to\nround here as anything but Greenshaw\u2019s Folly.\u2019\n\u2018Greenshaw being the man who built it?\u2019\n\u2018Yes. In eighteen-sixty or seventy or thereabouts. The\nlocal success story of the time. Barefoot boy who had risen\nto immense prosperity. Local opinion is divided as to why he\nbuilt this house, whether it was sheer exuberance of wealth\nor whether it was done to impress his creditors. If the latter,\nit didn\u2019t impress them. He either went bankrupt or the next\nthing to it. Hence the name, Greenshaw\u2019s Folly.\u2019\nHorace\u2019s camera clicked. \u2018There,\u2019 he said in a satis\ufb01ed\nvoice. \u2018Remind me to show you No. 310 in my collection. A\nreally incredible marble mantelpiece in the Italian manner.\u2019\nHe added, looking at the house, \u2018I can\u2019t conceive of how Mr\nGreenshaw thought of it all.\u2019\n\u2018Rather obvious in some ways,\u2019 said Raymond. \u2018He had\nvisited the cha^teaux of the Loire, don\u2019t you think? Those\nturrets. And then, rather unfortunately, he seems to have\ntravelled in the Orient. The in\ufb02uence of the Taj Mahal is\nunmistakable. I rather like the Moorish wing,\u2019 he added, \u2018and\nthe traces of a Venetian palace.\u2019\n\u2018One wonders how he ever got hold of an architect to\ncarry out these ideas.\u2019\nRaymond shrugged his shoulders.\n\u2018No di\ufb03culty about that, I expect,\u2019 he said. \u2018Probably the\narchitect retired with a good income for life while poor old\n\n----Page Break----\nGreenshaw went bankrupt.\u2019\n\u2018Could we look at it from the other side?\u2019 asked Horace,\n\u2018or are we trespassing!\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019re trespassing all right,\u2019 said Raymond, \u2018but I don\u2019t\nthink it will matter.\u2019\nHe turned towards the corner of the house and Horace\nskipped after him.\n\u2018But who lives here, my dear? Orphans or holiday\nvisitors? It can\u2019t be a school. No playing-\ufb01elds or brisk\ne\ufb03ciency.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, a Greenshaw lives here still,\u2019 said Raymond over his\nshoulder. \u2018The house itself didn\u2019t go in the crash. Old\nGreenshaw\u2019s son inherited it. He was a bit of a miser and\nlived here in a corner of it. Never spent a penny. Probably\nnever had a penny to spend. His daughter lives here now.\nOld lady\u2014very eccentric.\u2019\nAs he spoke Raymond was congratulating himself on\nhaving thought of Greenshaw\u2019s Folly as a means of\nentertaining \nhis \nguest. \nThese \nliterary \ncritics \nalways\nprofessed themselves as longing for a week-end in the\ncountry, and were wont to \ufb01nd the country extremely boring\nwhen they got there. Tomorrow there would be the Sunday\npapers, and for today Raymond West congratulated himself\non suggesting a visit to Greenshaw\u2019s Folly to enrich Horace\nBindler\u2019s well-known collection of monstrosities.\nThey turned the corner of the house and came out on a\nneglected lawn. In one corner of it was a large arti\ufb01cial\nrockery, and bending over it was a \ufb01gure at sight of which\nHorace clutched Raymond delightedly by the arm.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018My dear,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018do you see what she\u2019s got on?\nA sprigged print dress. Just like a housemaid\u2014when there\nwere housemaids. One of my most cherished memories is\nstaying at a house in the country when I was quite a boy\nwhere a real housemaid called you in the morning, all\ncrackling in a print dress and a cap. Yes, my boy, really\u2014a\ncap. Muslin with streamers. No, perhaps it was the parlour-\nmaid who had the streamers. But anyway she was a real\nhousemaid and she brought in an enormous brass can of hot\nwater. What an exciting day we\u2019re having.\u2019\nThe \ufb01gure in the print dress had straightened up and had\nturned towards them, trowel in hand. She was a su\ufb03ciently\nstartling \ufb01gure. Unkempt locks of iron-grey fell wispily on\nher shoulders, a straw hat rather like the hats that horses\nwear in Italy was crammed down on her head. The coloured\nprint dress she wore fell nearly to her ankles. Out of a\nweatherbeaten, not-too-clean face, shrewd eyes surveyed\nthem appraisingly.\n\u2018I must apologize for trespassing, Miss Greenshaw,\u2019 said\nRaymond West, as he advanced towards her, \u2018but Mr Horace\nBindler who is staying with me\u2014\u2019\nHorace bowed and removed his hat.\n\u2018\u2014is most interested in\u2014er\u2014ancient history and\u2014er\u2014\n\ufb01ne buildings.\u2019\nRaymond West spoke with the ease of a well-known\nauthor who knows that he is a celebrity, that he can venture\nwhere other people may not.\nMiss Greenshaw looked up at the sprawling exuberance\nbehind her.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018It is a \ufb01ne house,\u2019 she said appreciatively. \u2018My\ngrandfather built it\u2014before my time, of course. He is\nreported as having said that he wished to astonish the\nnatives.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll say he did that, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Horace Bindler.\n\u2018Mr Bindler is the well-known literary critic,\u2019 said\nRaymond West.\nMiss Greenshaw had clearly no reverence for literary\ncritics. She remained unimpressed.\n\u2018I consider it,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw, referring to the\nhouse, \u2018as a monument to my grandfather\u2019s genius. Silly\nfools come here, and ask me why I don\u2019t sell it and go and\nlive in a \ufb02at. What would I do in a \ufb02at? It\u2019s my home and I\nlive in it,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw. \u2018Always have lived here.\u2019\nShe considered, brooding over the past. \u2018There were three\nof us. Laura married the curate. Papa wouldn\u2019t give her any\nmoney, said clergymen ought to be unworldly. She died,\nhaving a baby. Baby died too. Nettie ran away with the\nriding master. Papa cut her out of his will, of course.\nHandsome fellow, Harry Fletcher, but no good. Don\u2019t think\nNettie was happy with him. Anyway, she didn\u2019t live long.\nThey had a son. He writes to me sometimes, but of course\nhe isn\u2019t a Greenshaw. I\u2019m the last of the Greenshaws.\u2019 She\ndrew up her bent shoulders with a certain pride, and\nreadjusted the rakish angle of the straw hat. Then, turning,\nshe said sharply,\n\u2018Yes, Mrs Cresswell, what is it?\u2019\nApproaching them from the house was a \ufb01gure that, seen\nside by side with Miss Greenshaw, seemed ludicrously\ndissimilar. Mrs Cresswell had a marvellously dressed head of\nwell-blued hair towering upwards in meticulously arranged\n\n----Page Break----\ncurls and rolls. It was as though she had dressed her head\nto go as a French marquise to a fancy-dressparty. The rest of\nher middle-aged person was dressed in what ought to have\nbeen rustling black silk but was actually one of the shinier\nvarieties of black rayon. Although she was not a large\nwoman, she had a well-developed and sumptuous bust. Her\nvoice when she spoke, was unexpectedly deep. She spoke\nwith exquisite diction, only a slight hesitation over words\nbeginning with \u2018h\u2019 and the \ufb01nal pronunciation of them with\nan exaggerated aspirate gave rise to a suspicion that at\nsome remote period in her youth she might have had\ntrouble over dropping her h\u2019s.\n\u2018The \ufb01sh, madam,\u2019 said Mrs Cresswell, \u2018the slice of cod. It\nhas not arrived. I have asked Alfred to go down for it and he\nrefuses to do so.\u2019\nRather unexpectedly, Miss Greenshaw gave a cackle of\nlaughter.\n\u2018Refuses, does he?\u2019\n\u2018Alfred, madam, has been most disobliging.\u2019\nMiss Greenshaw raised two earth-stained \ufb01ngers to her\nlips, suddenly produced an ear-splitting whistle and at the\nsame time yelled:\n\u2018Alfred. Alfred, come here.\u2019\nRound the corner of the house a young man appeared in\nanswer to the summons, carrying a spade in his hand. He\nhad a bold, handsome face and as he drew near he cast an\nunmistakably malevolent glance towards Mrs Cresswell.\n\u2018You wanted me, miss?\u2019 he said.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Yes, Alfred. I hear you\u2019ve refused to go down for the \ufb01sh.\nWhat about it, eh?\u2019\nAlfred spoke in a surly voice.\n\u2018I\u2019ll go down for it if you wants it, miss. You\u2019ve only got to\nsay.\u2019\n\u2018I do want it. I want it for my supper.\u2019\n\u2018Right you are, miss. I\u2019ll go right away.\u2019\nHe threw an insolent glance at Mrs Cresswell, who\n\ufb02ushed and murmured below her breath:\n\u2018Really! It\u2019s unsupportable.\u2019\n\u2018Now that I think of it,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw, \u2018a couple of\nstrange visitors are just what we need aren\u2019t they, Mrs\nCresswell?\u2019\nMrs Cresswell looked puzzled.\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, madam\u2014\u2019\n\u2018For you-know-what,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw, nodding her\nhead. \u2018Bene\ufb01ciary to a will mustn\u2019t witness it. That\u2019s right,\nisn\u2019t it?\u2019 She appealed to Raymond West.\n\u2018Quite correct,\u2019 said Raymond.\n\u2018I know enough law to know that,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw.\n\u2018And you two are men of standing.\u2019\nShe \ufb02ung down her trowel on her weeding-basket.\n\u2018Would you mind coming up to the library with me?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Delighted,\u2019 said Horace eagerly.\nShe led the way through french windows and through a\nvast yellow and gold drawing-room with faded brocade on\nthe walls and dust covers arranged over the furniture, then\nthrough a large dim hall, up a staircase and into a room on\nthe \ufb01rst \ufb02oor.\n\u2018My grandfather\u2019s library,\u2019 she announced.\nHorace looked round the room with acute pleasure. It\nwas a room, from his point of view, quite full of\nmonstrosities. The heads of sphinxes appeared on the most\nunlikely pieces of furniture, there was a colossal bronze\nrepresenting, he thought, Paul and Virginia, and a vast\nbronze clock with classical motifs of which he longed to take\na photograph.\n\u2018A \ufb01ne lot of books,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw.\nRaymond was already looking at the books. From what\nhe could see from a cursory glance there was no book here\nof any real interest or, indeed, any book which appeared to\nhave been read. They were all superbly bound sets of the\nclassics as supplied ninety years ago for furnishing a\ngentleman\u2019s library. Some novels of a bygone period were\nincluded. But they too showed little signs of having been\nread.\nMiss Greenshaw was fumbling in the drawers of a vast\ndesk. Finally she pulled out a parchment document.\n\u2018My will,\u2019 she explained. \u2018Got to leave your money to\nsomeone\u2014or so they say. If I died without a will I suppose\nthat son of a horse-coper would get it. Handsome fellow,\nHarry Fletcher, but a rogue if there ever was one. Don\u2019t see\nwhy his son should inherit this place. No,\u2019 she went on, as\n\n----Page Break----\nthough answering some unspoken objection, \u2018I\u2019ve made up\nmy mind. I\u2019m leaving it to Cresswell.\u2019\n\u2018Your housekeeper?\u2019\n\u2018Yes. I\u2019ve explained it to her. I make a will leaving her all\nI\u2019ve got and then I don\u2019t need to pay her any wages. Saves\nme a lot in current expenses, and it keeps her up to the\nmark. No giving me notice and walking o\ufb00 at any minute.\nVery la-di-dah and all that, isn\u2019t she? But her father was a\nworking plumber in a very small way. She\u2019s nothing to give\nherself airs about.\u2019\nShe had by now unfolded the parchment. Picking up a\npen she dipped it in the inkstand and wrote her signature,\nKatherine Dorothy Greenshaw.\n\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 she said. \u2018You\u2019ve seen me sign it, and then\nyou two sign it, and that makes it legal.\u2019\nShe handed the pen to Raymond West. He hesitated a\nmoment, feeling an unexpected repulsion to what he was\nasked to do. Then he quickly scrawled the well-known\nsignature, for which his morning\u2019s mail usually brought at\nleast six demands a day.\nHorace took the pen from him and added his own minute\nsignature.\n\u2018That\u2019s done,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw.\nShe moved across to the bookcase and stood looking at\nthem uncertainly, then she opened a glass door, took out a\nbook and slipped the folded parchment inside.\n\u2018I\u2019ve my own places for keeping things,\u2019 she said.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Lady \nAudley\u2019s \nSecret,\u2019 \nRaymond \nWest \nremarked,\ncatching sight of the title as she replaced the book.\nMiss Greenshaw gave another cackle of laughter.\n\u2018Best-seller in its day,\u2019 she remarked. \u2018Not like your\nbooks, eh?\u2019\nShe gave Raymond a sudden friendly nudge in the ribs.\nRaymond was rather surprised that she even knew he wrote\nbooks. Although Raymond West was quite a name in\nliterature, he could hardly be described as a best-seller.\nThough softening a little with the advent of middle-age, his\nbooks dealt bleakly with the sordid side of life.\n\u2018I wonder,\u2019 Horace demanded breathlessly, \u2018if I might just\ntake a photograph of the clock?\u2019\n\u2018By all means,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw. \u2018It came, I believe,\nfrom the Paris exhibition.\u2019\n\u2018Very probably,\u2019 said Horace. He took his picture.\n\u2018This room\u2019s not been used much since my grandfather\u2019s\ntime,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw. \u2018This desk\u2019s full of old diaries of\nhis. Interesting, I should think. I haven\u2019t the eyesight to read\nthem myself. I\u2019d like to get them published, but I suppose\none would have to work on them a good deal.\u2019\n\u2018You could engage someone to do that,\u2019 said Raymond\nWest.\n\u2018Could I really? It\u2019s an idea, you know. I\u2019ll think about it.\u2019\nRaymond West glanced at his watch.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018We mustn\u2019t trespass on your kindness any longer,\u2019 he\nsaid.\n\u2018Pleased to have seen you,\u2019 said Miss Greenshaw\ngraciously. \u2018Thought you were the policeman when I heard\nyou coming round the corner of the house.\u2019\n\u2018Why a policeman?\u2019 demanded Horace, who never\nminded asking questions.\nMiss Greenshaw responded unexpectedly.\n\u2018If you want to know the time, ask a policeman,\u2019 she\ncarolled, and with this example of Victorian wit, nudged\nHorace in the ribs and roared with laughter.\n\u2018It\u2019s been a wonderful afternoon,\u2019 sighed Horace as they\nwalked home. \u2018Really, that place has everything. The only\nthing the library needs is a body. Those old-fashioned\ndetective stories about murder in the library\u2014that\u2019s just the\nkind of library I\u2019m sure the authors had in mind.\u2019\n\u2018If you want to discuss murder,\u2019 said Raymond, \u2018you must\ntalk to my Aunt Jane.\u2019\n\u2018Your Aunt Jane? Do you mean Miss Marple?\u2019 He felt a\nlittle at a loss.\nThe charming old-world lady to whom he had been\nintroduced the night before seemed the last person to be\nmentioned in connection with murder.\n\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said Raymond. \u2018Murder is a speciality of hers.\u2019\n\u2018But my dear, how intriguing. What do you really mean?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I mean just that,\u2019 said Raymond. He paraphrased: \u2018Some\ncommit murder, some get mixed up in murders, others have\nmurder thrust upon them. My Aunt Jane comes into the third\ncategory.\u2019\n\u2018You are joking.\u2019\n\u2018Not in the least. I can refer you to the former\nCommissioner of Scotland Yard, several Chief Constables\nand one or two hard-working inspectors of the CID.\u2019\nHorace said happily that wonders would never cease.\nOver the tea table they gave Joan West, Raymond\u2019s wife,\nLou Oxley her niece, and old Miss Marple, ar\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the\nafternoon\u2019s happenings, recounting in detail everything that\nMiss Greenshaw had said to them.\n\u2018But I do think,\u2019 said Horace, \u2018that there is something a\nlittle sinister about the whole set-up. That duchess-like\ncreature, the housekeeper\u2014arsenic, perhaps, in the teapot,\nnow that she knows her mistress has made the will in her\nfavour?\u2019\n\u2018Tell us, Aunt Jane,\u2019 said Raymond. \u2018Will there be murder\nor won\u2019t there? What do you think?\u2019\n\u2018I think,\u2019 said Miss Marple, winding up her wool with a\nrather severe air, \u2018that you shouldn\u2019t joke about these\nthings as much as you do, Raymond. Arsenic is, of course,\nquite a possibility. So easy to obtain. Probably present in the\ntoolshed already in the form of weed killer.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, really, darling,\u2019 said Joan West, a\ufb00ectionately.\n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t that be rather too obvious?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s all very well to make a will,\u2019 said Raymond, \u2018I don\u2019t\nsuppose really the poor old thing has anything to leave\n\n----Page Break----\nexcept that awful white elephant of a house, and who would\nwant that?\u2019\n\u2018A \ufb01lm company possibly,\u2019 said Horace, \u2018or a hotel or an\ninstitution?\u2019\n\u2018They\u2019d expect to buy it for a song,\u2019 said Raymond, but\nMiss Marple was shaking her head.\n\u2018You know, dear Raymond, I cannot agree with you there.\nAbout the money, I mean. The grandfather was evidently\none of those lavish spenders who make money easily, but\ncan\u2019t keep it. He may have gone broke, as you say, but\nhardly bankrupt or else his son would not have had the\nhouse. Now the son, as is so often the case, was an entirely\ndi\ufb00erent character to his father. A miser. A man who saved\nevery penny. I should say that in the course of his lifetime\nhe probably put by a very good sum. This Miss Greenshaw\nappears to have taken after him, to dislike spending money,\nthat is. Yes, I should think it quite likely that she had quite a\ngood sum tucked away.\u2019\n\u2018In that case,\u2019 said Joan West, \u2018I wonder now\u2014what about\nLou?\u2019\nThey looked at Lou as she sat, silent, by the \ufb01re.\nLou was Joan West\u2019s niece. Her marriage had recently, as\nshe herself put it, come unstuck, leaving her with two young\nchildren and a bare su\ufb03ciency of money to keep them on.\n\u2018I mean,\u2019 said Joan, \u2018if this Miss Greenshaw really wants\nsomeone to go through diaries and get a book ready for\npublication\u2026\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s an idea,\u2019 said Raymond.\n\n----Page Break----\nLou said in a low voice:\n\u2018It\u2019s work I could do\u2014and I\u2019d enjoy it.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll write to her,\u2019 said Raymond.\n\u2018I wonder,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully, \u2018what the old\nlady meant by that remark about a policeman?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, it was just a joke.\u2019\n\u2018It reminded me,\u2019 said Miss Marple, nodding her head\nvigorously, \u2018yes, it reminded me very much of Mr Naysmith.\u2019\n\u2018Who was Mr Naysmith?\u2019 asked Raymond, curiously.\n\u2018He kept bees,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018and was very good at\ndoing the acrostics in the Sunday papers. And he liked\ngiving people false impressions just for fun. But sometimes\nit led to trouble.\u2019\nEverybody was silent for a moment, considering Mr\nNaysmith, but as there did not seem to be any points of\nresemblance between him and Miss Greenshaw, they\ndecided that dear Aunt Jane was perhaps getting a little bit\ndisconnected in her old age.\nII\nHorace Bindler went back to London without having\ncollected any more monstrosities and Raymond West wrote\na letter to Miss Greenshaw telling her that he knew of a Mrs\nLouisa Oxley who would be competent to undertake work on\nthe diaries. After a lapse of some days, a letter arrived,\nwritten in spidery old-fashioned handwriting, in which Miss\nGreenshaw declared herself anxious to avail herself of the\n\n----Page Break----\nservices of Mrs Oxley, and making an appointment for Mrs\nOxley to come and see her.\nLou duly kept the appointment, generous terms were\narranged and she started work on the following day.\n\u2018I\u2019m awfully grateful to you,\u2019 she said to Raymond. \u2018It will\n\ufb01t in beautifully. I can take the children to school, go on to\nGreenshaw\u2019s Folly and pick them up on my way back. How\nfantastic the whole set-up is! That old woman has to be\nseen to be believed.\u2019\nOn the evening of her \ufb01rst day at work she returned and\ndescribed her day.\n\u2018I\u2019ve hardly seen the housekeeper,\u2019 she said. \u2018She came\nin with co\ufb00ee and biscuits at half past eleven with her\nmouth pursed up very prunes and prisms, and would hardly\nspeak to me. I think she disapproves deeply of my having\nbeen engaged.\u2019 She went on, \u2018It seems there\u2019s quite a feud\nbetween her and the gardener, Alfred. He\u2019s a local boy and\nfairly lazy, I should imagine, and he and the housekeeper\nwon\u2019t speak to each other. Miss Greenshaw said in her\nrather grand way, \u201cThere have always been feuds as far as I\ncan remember between the garden and the house sta\ufb00. It\nwas so in my grandfather\u2019s time. There were three men and\na boy in the garden then, and eight maids in the house, but\nthere was always friction.\u201d \u2019\nOn the following day Lou returned with another piece of\nnews.\n\u2018Just fancy,\u2019 she said, \u2018I was asked to ring up the nephew\nthis morning.\u2019\n\u2018Miss Greenshaw\u2019s nephew?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Yes. It seems he\u2019s an actor playing in the company that\u2019s\ndoing a summer season at Boreham on Sea. I rang up the\ntheatre and left a message asking him to lunch tomorrow.\nRather fun, really. The old girl didn\u2019t want the housekeeper\nto know. I think Mrs Cresswell has done something that\u2019s\nannoyed her.\u2019\n\u2018Tomorrow another instalment of this thrilling serial,\u2019\nmurmured Raymond.\n\u2018It\u2019s exactly like a serial, isn\u2019t it? Reconciliation with the\nnephew, blood is thicker than water\u2014another will to be\nmade and the old will destroyed.\u2019\n\u2018Aunt Jane, you\u2019re looking very serious.\u2019\n\u2018Was I, my dear? Have you heard any more about the\npoliceman?\u2019\nLou looked bewildered. \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about a\npoliceman.\u2019\n\u2018That remark of hers, my dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018must\nhave meant something.\u2019\nLou arrived at her work the next day in a cheerful mood.\nShe passed through the open front door\u2014the doors and\nwindows of the house were always open. Miss Greenshaw\nappeared to have no fear of burglars, and was probably\njusti\ufb01ed, as most things in the house weighed several tons\nand were of no marketable value.\nLou had passed Alfred in the drive. When she \ufb01rst caught\nsight of him he had been leaning against a tree smoking a\ncigarette, but as soon as he had caught sight of her he had\nseized a broom and begun diligently to sweep leaves. An\nidle young man, she thought, but good looking. His features\n\n----Page Break----\nreminded her of someone. As she passed through the hall\non her way upstairs to the library she glanced at the large\npicture of Nathaniel Greenshaw which presided over the\nmantelpiece, showing him in the acme of Victorian\nprosperity, leaning back in a large arm-chair, his hands\nresting on the gold albert across his capacious stomach. As\nher glance swept up from the stomach to the face with its\nheavy jowls, its bushy eyebrows and its \ufb02ourishing black\nmoustache, the thought occurred to her that Nathaniel\nGreenshaw must have been handsome as a young man. He\nhad looked, perhaps, a little like Alfred\u2026\nShe went into the library, shut the door behind her,\nopened her typewriter and got out the diaries from the\ndrawer at the side of the desk. Through the open window\nshe caught a glimpse of Miss Greenshaw in a puce-coloured\nsprigged \nprint, \nbending \nover \nthe \nrockery, \nweeding\nassiduously. They had had two wet days, of which the weeds\nhad taken full advantage.\nLou, a town-bred girl, decided that if she ever had a\ngarden it would never contain a rockery which needed hand\nweeding. Then she settled down to her work.\nWhen Mrs Cresswell entered the library with the co\ufb00ee\ntray at half past eleven, she was clearly in a very bad\ntemper. She banged the tray down on the table, and\nobserved to the universe.\n\u2018Company for lunch\u2014and nothing in the house! What am\nI supposed to do, I should like to know? And no sign of\nAlfred.\u2019\n\u2018He was sweeping in the drive when I got here,\u2019 Lou\no\ufb00ered.\n\u2018I dare say. A nice soft job.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nMrs Cresswell swept out of the room and banged the\ndoor behind her. Lou grinned to herself. She wondered what\n\u2018the nephew\u2019 would be like.\nShe \ufb01nished her co\ufb00ee and settled down to her work\nagain. It was so absorbing that time passed quickly.\nNathaniel Greenshaw, when he started to keep a diary, had\nsuccumbed to the pleasure of frankness. Trying out a\npassage relating to the personal charm of a barmaid in the\nneighbouring town, Lou re\ufb02ected that a good deal of editing\nwould be necessary.\nAs she was thinking this, she was startled by a scream\nfrom the garden. Jumping up, she ran to the open window.\nMiss Greenshaw was staggering away from the rockery\ntowards the house. Her hands were clasped to her breast\nand between them there protruded a feathered shaft that\nLou recognized with stupefaction to be the shaft of an arrow.\nMiss Greenshaw\u2019s head, in its battered straw hat, fell\nforward on her breast. She called up to Lou in a failing voice:\n\u2018\u2026shot\u2026he shot me\u2026with an arrow\u2026get help\u2026\u2019\nLou rushed to the door. She turned the handle, but the\ndoor would not open. It took her a moment or two of futile\nendeavour to realize that she was locked in. She rushed\nback to the window.\n\u2018I\u2019m locked in.\u2019\nMiss Greenshaw, her back towards Lou, and swaying a\nlittle on her feet was calling up to the housekeeper at a\nwindow farther along.\n\u2018Ring police\u2026telephone\u2026\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThen, lurching from side to side like a drunkard she\ndisappeared from Lou\u2019s view through the window below into\nthe drawing-room. A moment later Lou heard a crash of\nbroken china, a heavy fall, and then silence. Her imagination\nreconstructed the scene. Miss Greenshaw must have\nstaggered blindly into a small table with a S\u00e8vres teaset on\nit.\nDesperately Lou pounded on the door, calling and\nshouting. There was no creeper or drain-pipe outside the\nwindow that could help her to get out that way.\nTired at last of beating on the door, she returned to the\nwindow. From the window of her sitting-room farther along,\nthe housekeeper\u2019s head appeared.\n\u2018Come and let me out, Mrs Oxley. I\u2019m locked in.\u2019\n\u2018So am I.\u2019\n\u2018Oh dear, isn\u2019t it awful? I\u2019ve telephoned the police.\nThere\u2019s an extension in this room, but what I can\u2019t\nunderstand, Mrs Oxley, is our being locked in. I never heard\na key turn, did you?\u2019\n\u2018No. I didn\u2019t hear anything at all. Oh dear, what shall we\ndo? Perhaps Alfred might hear us.\u2019 Lou shouted at the top of\nher voice, \u2018Alfred, Alfred.\u2019\n\u2018Gone to his dinner as likely as not. What time is it?\u2019\nLou glanced at her watch.\n\u2018Twenty-\ufb01ve past twelve.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s not supposed to go until half past, but he sneaks o\ufb00\nearlier whenever he can.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018Do you think\u2014do you think\u2014\u2019\nLou meant to ask \u2018Do you think she\u2019s dead?\u2019 but the\nwords stuck in her throat.\nThere was nothing to do but wait. She sat down on the\nwindow-sill. It seemed an eternity before the stolid helmeted\n\ufb01gure of a police constable came round the corner of the\nhouse. She leant out of the window and he looked up at her,\nshading his eyes with his hand. When he spoke his voice\nheld reproof.\n\u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 he asked disapprovingly.\nFrom their respective windows, Lou and Mrs Cresswell\npoured a \ufb02ood of excited information down on him.\nThe constable produced a note-book and pencil. \u2018You\nladies ran upstairs and locked yourselves in? Can I have\nyour names, please?\u2019\n\u2018No. Somebody else locked us in. Come and let us out.\u2019\nThe constable said reprovingly, \u2018All in good time,\u2019 and\ndisappeared through the window below.\nOnce again time seemed in\ufb01nite. Lou heard the sound of\na car arriving, and, after what seemed an hour, but was\nactually three minutes, \ufb01rst Mrs Cresswell and then Lou,\nwere released by a police sergeant more alert than the\noriginal constable.\n\u2018Miss Greenshaw?\u2019 Lou\u2019s voice faltered. \u2018What\u2014what\u2019s\nhappened?\u2019\nThe sergeant cleared his throat.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you, madam,\u2019 he said, \u2018what I\u2019ve\nalready told Mrs Cresswell here. Miss Greenshaw is dead.\u2019\n\u2018Murdered,\u2019 said Mrs Cresswell. \u2018That\u2019s what it is\u2014\nmurder.\u2019\nThe sergeant said dubiously:\n\u2018Could have been an accident\u2014some country lads\nshooting with bows and arrows.\u2019\nAgain there was the sound of a car arriving. The sergeant\nsaid:\n\u2018That\u2019ll be the MO,\u2019 and started downstairs.\nBut it was not the MO. As Lou and Mrs Cresswell came\ndown the stairs a young man stepped hesitatingly through\nthe front door and paused, looking round him with a\nsomewhat bewildered air.\nThen, speaking in a pleasant voice that in some way\nseemed \nfamiliar \nto \nLou\u2014perhaps \nit \nhad \na \nfamily\nresemblance to Miss Greenshaw\u2019s\u2014he asked:\n\u2018Excuse me, does\u2014er\u2014does Miss Greenshaw live here?\u2019\n\u2018May I have your name if you please,\u2019 said the sergeant\nadvancing upon him.\n\u2018Fletcher,\u2019 said the young man. \u2018Nat Fletcher. I\u2019m Miss\nGreenshaw\u2019s nephew, as a matter of fact.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed, sir, well\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019m sure\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Has anything happened?\u2019 asked Nat Fletcher.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018There\u2019s been an\u2014accident\u2014your aunt was shot with an\narrow\u2014penetrated the jugular vein\u2014\u2019\nMrs Cresswell spoke hysterically and without her usual\nre\ufb01nement:\n\u2018Your h\u2019aunt\u2019s been murdered, that\u2019s what\u2019s \u2019appened.\nYour h\u2019aunt\u2019s been murdered.\u2019\nIII\nInspector Welch drew his chair a little nearer to the table\nand let his gaze wander from one to the other of the four\npeople in the room. It was the evening of the same day. He\nhad called at the Wests\u2019 house to take Lou Oxley once more\nover her statement.\n\u2018You are sure of the exact words? Shot\u2014he shot me\u2014with\nan arrow\u2014get help?\u2019\nLou nodded.\n\u2018And the time?\u2019\n\u2018I looked at my watch a minute or two later\u2014it was then\ntwelve twenty-\ufb01ve.\u2019\n\u2018Your watch keeps good time?\u2019\n\u2018I looked at the clock as well.\u2019\nThe inspector turned to Raymond West.\n\u2018It appears, sir, that about a week ago you and a Mr\nHorace Bindler were witnesses to Miss Greenshaw\u2019s will?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nBrie\ufb02y, Raymond recounted the events of the afternoon\nvisit that he and Horace Bindler had paid to Greenshaw\u2019s\nFolly.\n\u2018This testimony of yours may be important,\u2019 said Welch.\n\u2018Miss Greenshaw distinctly told you, did she, that her will\nwas \nbeing \nmade \nin \nfavour \nof \nMrs \nCresswell, \nthe\nhousekeeper, that she was not paying Mrs Cresswell any\nwages in view of the expectations Mrs Cresswell had of\npro\ufb01ting by her death?\u2019\n\u2018That is what she told me\u2014yes.\u2019\n\u2018Would you say that Mrs Cresswell was de\ufb01nitely aware\nof these facts?\u2019\n\u2018I should say undoubtedly. Miss Greenshaw made a\nreference in my presence to bene\ufb01ciaries not being able to\nwitness a will and Mrs Cresswell clearly understood what\nshe meant by it. Moreover, Miss Greenshaw herself told me\nthat she had come to this arrangement with Mrs Cresswell.\u2019\n\u2018So Mrs Cresswell had reason to believe she was an\ninterested party. Motive\u2019s clear enough in her case, and I\ndare say she\u2019d be our chief suspect now if it wasn\u2019t for the\nfact that she was securely locked in her room like Mrs Oxley\nhere, and also that Miss Greenshaw de\ufb01nitely said a man\nshot her\u2014\u2019\n\u2018She de\ufb01nitely was locked in her room?\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes. Sergeant Cayley let her out. It\u2019s a big old-\nfashioned lock with a big old-fashioned key. The key was in\nthe lock and there\u2019s not a chance that it could have been\nturned from inside or any hanky-panky of that kind. No, you\ncan take it de\ufb01nitely that Mrs Cresswell was locked inside\nthat room and couldn\u2019t get out. And there were no bows and\n\n----Page Break----\narrows in the room and Miss Greenshaw couldn\u2019t in any case\nhave been shot from a window\u2014the angle forbids it\u2014no,\nMrs Cresswell\u2019s out of it.\u2019\nHe paused and went on:\n\u2018Would you say that Miss Greenshaw, in your opinion,\nwas a practical joker?\u2019\nMiss Marple looked up sharply from her corner.\n\u2018So the will wasn\u2019t in Mrs Cresswell\u2019s favour after all?\u2019 she\nsaid.\nInspector Welch looked over at her in a rather surprised\nfashion.\n\u2018That\u2019s a very clever guess of yours, madam,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018No. Mrs Cresswell isn\u2019t named as bene\ufb01ciary.\u2019\n\u2018Just like Mr Naysmith,\u2019 said Miss Marple, nodding her\nhead. \u2018Miss Greenshaw told Mrs Cresswell she was going to\nleave her everything and so got out of paying her wages;\nand then she left her money to somebody else. No doubt\nshe was vastly pleased with herself. No wonder she chortled\nwhen she put the will away in Lady Audley\u2019s Secret.\u2019\n\u2018It was lucky Mrs Oxley was able to tell us about the will\nand where it was put,\u2019 said the inspector. \u2018We might have\nhad a long hunt for it otherwise.\u2019\n\u2018A Victorian sense of humour,\u2019 murmured Raymond West.\n\u2018So she left her money to her nephew after all,\u2019 said Lou.\nThe inspector shook his head.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018she didn\u2019t leave it to Nat Fletcher. The\nstory goes around here\u2014of course I\u2019m new to the place and\nI only get the gossip that\u2019s second-hand\u2014but it seems that\nin the old days both Miss Greenshaw and her sister were set\non the handsome young riding master, and the sister got\nhim. No, she didn\u2019t leave the money to her nephew\u2014\u2019 He\npaused, rubbing his chin, \u2018She left it to Alfred,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Alfred\u2014the gardener?\u2019 Joan spoke in a surprised voice.\n\u2018Yes, Mrs West. Alfred Pollock.\u2019\n\u2018But why?\u2019 cried Lou.\nMiss Marple coughed and murmured:\n\u2018I should imagine, though perhaps I am wrong, that there\nmay have been\u2014what we might call family reasons.\u2019\n\u2018You could call them that in a way,\u2019 agreed the inspector.\n\u2018It\u2019s quite well known in the village, it seems, that Thomas\nPollock, Alfred\u2019s grandfather, was one of old Mr Greenshaw\u2019s\nby-blows.\u2019\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 cried Lou, \u2018the resemblance! I saw it this\nmorning.\u2019\nShe remembered how after passing Alfred she had come\ninto the house and looked up at old Greenshaw\u2019s portrait.\n\u2018I dare say,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018that she thought Alfred\nPollock might have a pride in the house, might even want to\nlive in it, whereas her nephew would almost certainly have\nno use for it whatever and would sell it as soon as he could\npossibly do so. He\u2019s an actor, isn\u2019t he? What play exactly is\nhe acting in at present?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nTrust an old lady to wander from the point, thought\nInspector Welch, but he replied civilly:\n\u2018I believe, madam, they are doing a season of James\nBarrie\u2019s plays.\u2019\n\u2018Barrie,\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully.\n\u2018What Every Woman Knows,\u2019 said Inspector Welch, and\nthen blushed. \u2018Name of a play,\u2019 he said quickly. \u2018I\u2019m not\nmuch of a theatre-goer myself,\u2019 he added, \u2018but the wife\nwent along and saw it last week. Quite well done, she said it\nwas.\u2019\n\u2018Barrie wrote some very charming plays,\u2019 said Miss\nMarple, \u2018though I must say that when I went with an old\nfriend of mine, General Easterly, to see Barrie\u2019s Little Mary\n\u2014\u2019 she shook her head sadly, \u2018\u2014neither of us knew where to\nlook.\u2019\nThe inspector, unacquainted with the play Little Mary\nlooked completely fogged. Miss Marple explained:\n\u2018When I was a girl, Inspector, nobody ever mentioned the\nword stomach.\u2019\nThe inspector looked even more at sea. Miss Marple was\nmurmuring titles under her breath.\n\u2018The Admirable Crichton. Very clever. Mary Rose\u2014a\ncharming play. I cried, I remember. Quality Street I didn\u2019t\ncare for so much. Then there was A Kiss for Cinderella. Oh,\nof course.\u2019\nInspector Welch had no time to waste on theatrical\ndiscussion. He returned to the matter in hand.\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018The question is,\u2019 he said, \u2018did Alfred Pollock know that\nthe old lady had made a will in his favour? Did she tell him?\u2019\nHe added: \u2018You see\u2014there\u2019s an archery club over at\nBoreham Lovell and Alfred Pollock\u2019s a member. He\u2019s a very\ngood shot indeed with a bow and arrow.\u2019\n\u2018Then isn\u2019t your case quite clear?\u2019 asked Raymond West.\n\u2018It would \ufb01t in with the doors being locked on the two\nwomen\u2014he\u2019d know just where they were in the house.\u2019\nThe inspector looked at him. He spoke with deep\nmelancholy.\n\u2018He\u2019s got an alibi,\u2019 said the inspector.\n\u2018I always think alibis are de\ufb01nitely suspicious.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe, sir,\u2019 said Inspector Welch. \u2018You\u2019re talking as a\nwriter.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t write detective stories,\u2019 said Raymond West,\nhorri\ufb01ed at the mere idea.\n\u2018Easy enough to say that alibis are suspicious,\u2019 went on\nInspector Welch, \u2018but unfortunately we\u2019ve got to deal with\nfacts.\u2019\nHe sighed.\n\u2018We\u2019ve got three good suspects,\u2019 he said. \u2018Three people\nwho, as it happened, were very close upon the scene at the\ntime. Yet the odd thing is that it looks as though none of the\nthree could have done it. The housekeeper I\u2019ve already\ndealt with\u2014the nephew, Nat Fletcher, at the moment Miss\nGreenshaw was shot, was a couple of miles away \ufb01lling up\nhis car at a garage and asking his way\u2014as for Alfred Pollock\nsix people will swear that he entered the Dog and Duck at\n\n----Page Break----\ntwenty past twelve and was there for an hour having his\nusual bread and cheese and beer.\u2019\n\u2018Deliberately establishing an alibi,\u2019 said Raymond West\nhopefully.\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Inspector Welch, \u2018but if so, he did establish\nit.\u2019\nThere was a long silence. Then Raymond turned his head\nto where Miss Marple sat upright and thoughtful.\n\u2018It\u2019s up to you, Aunt Jane,\u2019 he said. \u2018The inspector\u2019s\nba\ufb04ed, the sergeant\u2019s ba\ufb04ed, I\u2019m ba\ufb04ed, Joan\u2019s ba\ufb04ed,\nLou is ba\ufb04ed. But to you, Aunt Jane, it is crystal clear. Am I\nright?\u2019\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say that, dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018not crystal\nclear, and murder, dear Raymond, isn\u2019t a game. I don\u2019t\nsuppose poor Miss Greenshaw wanted to die, and it was a\nparticularly brutal murder. Very well planned and quite cold\nblooded. It\u2019s not a thing to make jokes about!\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Raymond, abashed. \u2018I\u2019m not really as\ncallous as I sound. One treats a thing lightly to take away\nfrom the\u2014well, the horror of it.\u2019\n\u2018That is, I believe, the modern tendency,\u2019 said Miss\nMarple, \u2018All these wars, and having to joke about funerals.\nYes, perhaps I was thoughtless when I said you were\ncallous.\u2019\n\u2018It isn\u2019t,\u2019 said Joan, \u2018as though we\u2019d known her at all well.\u2019\n\u2018That is very true,\u2019 said Miss Marple. \u2018You, dear Joan, did\nnot know her at all. I did not know her at all. Raymond\n\n----Page Break----\ngathered an impression of her from one afternoon\u2019s\nconversation. Lou knew her for two days.\u2019\n\u2018Come now, Aunt Jane,\u2019 said Raymond, \u2018tell us your\nviews. You don\u2019t mind, Inspector?\u2019\n\u2018Not at all,\u2019 said the inspector politely.\n\u2018Well, my dear, it would seem that we have three people\nwho had, or might have thought they had, a motive to kill\nthe old lady. And three quite simple reasons why none of the\nthree could have done so. The housekeeper could not have\ndone so because she was locked in her room and because\nMiss Greenshaw de\ufb01nitely stated that a man shot her. The\ngardener could not have done it because he was inside the\nDog and Duck at the time the murder was committed, the\nnephew could not have done it because he was still some\ndistance away in his car at the time of the murder.\u2019\n\u2018Very clearly put, madam,\u2019 said the inspector.\n\u2018And since it seems most unlikely that any outsider\nshould have done it, where, then, are we?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what the inspector wants to know,\u2019 said Raymond\nWest.\n\u2018One so often looks at a thing the wrong way round,\u2019 said\nMiss Marple apologetically. \u2018If we can\u2019t alter the movements\nor the position of those three people, then couldn\u2019t we\nperhaps alter the time of the murder?\u2019\n\u2018You mean that both my watch and the clock were\nwrong?\u2019 asked Lou.\n\u2018No dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018I didn\u2019t mean that at all. I\nmean that the murder didn\u2019t occur when you thought it\n\n----Page Break----\noccurred.\u2019\n\u2018But I saw it,\u2019 cried Lou.\n\u2018Well, what I have been wondering, my dear, was\nwhether you weren\u2019t meant to see it. I\u2019ve been asking\nmyself, you know, whether that wasn\u2019t the real reason why\nyou were engaged for this job.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean, Aunt Jane?\u2019\n\u2018Well, dear, it seems odd. Miss Greenshaw did not like\nspending money, and yet she engaged you and agreed\nquite willingly to the terms you asked. It seems to me that\nperhaps you were meant to be there in that library on the\n\ufb01rst \ufb02oor, looking out of the window so that you could be\nthe key witness\u2014someone from outside of irreproachable\ngood faith\u2014to \ufb01x a de\ufb01nite time and place for the murder.\u2019\n\u2018But you can\u2019t mean,\u2019 said Lou, incredulously, \u2018that Miss\nGreenshaw intended to be murdered.\u2019\n\u2018What I mean, dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple, \u2018is that you didn\u2019t\nreally know Miss Greenshaw. There\u2019s no real reason, is\nthere, why the Miss Greenshaw you saw when you went up\nto the house should be the same Miss Greenshaw that\nRaymond saw a few days earlier? Oh, yes, I know,\u2019 she went\non, to prevent Lou\u2019s reply, \u2018she was wearing the peculiar\nold-fashioned print dress and the strange straw hat, and had\nunkempt hair. She corresponded exactly to the description\nRaymond gave us last week-end. But those two women, you\nknow, were much of an age and height and size. The\nhousekeeper, I mean, and Miss Greenshaw.\u2019\n\u2018But the housekeeper is fat!\u2019 Lou exclaimed. \u2018She\u2019s got an\nenormous bosom.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nMiss Marple coughed.\n\u2018But my dear, surely, nowadays I have seen\u2014er\u2014them\nmyself in shops most indelicately displayed. It is very easy\nfor anyone to have a\u2014a bust\u2014of any size and dimension.\u2019\n\u2018What are you trying to say?\u2019 demanded Raymond.\n\u2018I was just thinking, dear, that during the two or three\ndays Lou was working there, one woman could have played\nthe two parts. You said yourself, Lou, that you hardly saw\nthe housekeeper, except for the one moment in the morning\nwhen she brought you in the tray with co\ufb00ee. One sees\nthose clever artists on the stage coming in as di\ufb00erent\ncharacters with only a minute or two to spare, and I am sure\nthe change could have been e\ufb00ected quite easily. That\nmarquise head-dress could be just a wig slipped on and o\ufb00.\u2019\n\u2018Aunt Jane! Do you mean that Miss Greenshaw was dead\nbefore I started work there?\u2019\n\u2018Not dead. Kept under drugs, I should say. A very easy job\nfor an unscrupulous woman like the housekeeper to do.\nThen she made the arrangements with you and got you to\ntelephone to the nephew to ask him to lunch at a de\ufb01nite\ntime. The only person who would have known that this Miss\nGreenshaw was not Miss Greenshaw would have been\nAlfred. And if you remember, the \ufb01rst two days you were\nworking there it was wet, and Miss Greenshaw stayed in the\nhouse. Alfred never came into the house because of his feud\nwith the housekeeper. And on the last morning Alfred was in\nthe drive, while Miss Greenshaw was working on the rockery\n\u2014I\u2019d like to have a look at that rockery.\u2019\n\u2018Do you mean it was Mrs Cresswell who killed Miss\nGreenshaw?\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\n\u2018I think that after bringing you your co\ufb00ee, the woman\nlocked the door on you as she went out, carried the\nunconscious Miss Greenshaw down to the drawing-room,\nthen assumed her \u201cMiss Greenshaw\u201d disguise and went out\nto work on the rockery where you could see her from the\nwindow. In due course she screamed and came staggering\nto the house clutching an arrow as though it had penetrated\nher throat. She called for help and was careful to say \u201che\nshot me\u201d so as to remove suspicion from the housekeeper.\nShe also called up to the housekeeper\u2019s window as though\nshe saw her there. Then, once inside the drawing-room, she\nthrew over a table with porcelain on it\u2014and ran quickly\nupstairs, put on her marquise wig and was able a few\nmoments later to lean her head out of the window and tell\nyou that she, too, was locked in.\u2019\n\u2018But she was locked in,\u2019 said Lou.\n\u2018I know. That is where the policeman comes in.\u2019\n\u2018What policeman?\u2019\n\u2018Exactly\u2014what policeman? I wonder, Inspector, if you\nwould mind telling me how and when you arrived on the\nscene?\u2019\nThe inspector looked a little puzzled.\n\u2018At twelve twenty-nine we received a telephone call from\nMrs Cresswell, housekeeper to Miss Greenshaw, stating that\nher mistress had been shot. Sergeant Cayley and myself\nwent out there at once in a car and arrived at the house at\ntwelve thirty-\ufb01ve. We found Miss Greenshaw dead and the\ntwo ladies locked in their rooms.\u2019\n\u2018So, you see, my dear,\u2019 said Miss Marple to Lou. \u2018The\npolice constable you saw wasn\u2019t a real police constable. You\n\n----Page Break----\nnever thought of him again\u2014one doesn\u2019t\u2014one just accepts\none more uniform as part of the law.\u2019\n\u2018But who\u2014why?\u2019\n\u2018As to who\u2014well, if they are playing A Kiss for Cinderella,\na policeman is the principal character. Nat Fletcher would\nonly have to help himself to the costume he wears on the\nstage. He\u2019d ask his way at a garage being careful to call\nattention to the time\u2014twelve twenty-\ufb01ve, then drive on\nquickly, leave his car round a corner, slip on his police\nuniform and do his \u201cact\u201d.\u2019\n\u2018But why?\u2014why?\u2019\n\u2018Someone had to lock the housekeeper\u2019s door on the\noutside, and someone had to drive the arrow through Miss\nGreenshaw\u2019s throat. You can stab anyone with an arrow just\nas well as by shooting it\u2014but it needs force.\u2019\n\u2018You mean they were both in it?\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes, I think so. Mother and son as likely as not.\u2019\n\u2018But Miss Greenshaw\u2019s sister died long ago.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, but I\u2019ve no doubt Mr Fletcher married again. He\nsounds the sort of man who would, and I think it possible\nthat the child died too, and that this so-called nephew was\nthe second wife\u2019s child, and not really a relation at all. The\nwoman got a post as housekeeper and spied out the land.\nThen he wrote as her nephew and proposed to call upon her\n\u2014he may have made some joking reference to coming in his\npoliceman\u2019s uniform\u2014or asked her over to see the play. But\nI think she suspected the truth and refused to see him. He\nwould have been her heir if she had died without making a\nwill\u2014but of course once she had made a will in the\n\n----Page Break----\nhousekeeper\u2019s favour (as they thought) then it was clear\nsailing.\u2019\n\u2018But why use an arrow?\u2019 objected Joan. \u2018So very far\nfetched.\u2019\n\u2018Not far fetched at all, dear. Alfred belonged to an\narchery club\u2014Alfred was meant to take the blame. The fact\nthat he was in the pub as early as twelve twenty was most\nunfortunate from their point of view. He always left a little\nbefore his proper time and that would have been just right\n\u2014\u2019 she shook her head. \u2018It really seems all wrong\u2014morally, I\nmean, that Alfred\u2019s laziness should have saved his life.\u2019\nThe inspector cleared his throat.\n\u2018Well, madam, these suggestions of yours are very\ninteresting. I shall have, of course, to investigate\u2014\u2019\nIV\nMiss Marple and Raymond West stood by the rockery and\nlooked down at that gardening basket full of dying\nvegetation.\nMiss Marple murmured:\n\u2018Alyssum, saxifrage, cytisus, thimble campanula\u2026Yes,\nthat\u2019s all the proof I need. Whoever was weeding here\nyesterday morning was no gardener\u2014she pulled up plants\nas well as weeds. So now I know I\u2019m right. Thank you, dear\nRaymond, for bringing me here. I wanted to see the place\nfor myself.\u2019\nShe and Raymond both looked up at the outrageous pile\nof Greenshaw\u2019s Folly.\n\n----Page Break----\nA cough made them turn. A handsome young man was\nalso looking at the house.\n\u2018Plaguey big place,\u2019 he said. \u2018Too big for nowadays\u2014or so\nthey say. I dunno about that. If I won a football pool and\nmade a lot of money, that\u2019s the kind of house I\u2019d like to\nbuild.\u2019\nHe smiled bashfully at them.\n\u2018Reckon I can say so now\u2014that there house was built by\nmy great-grandfather,\u2019 said Alfred Pollock. \u2018And a \ufb01ne house\nit is, for all they call it Greenshaw\u2019s Folly!\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nE-Book Extras\nThe Marples\nEssay by Charles Osborne\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Marples\n\u00a0\nThe Murder at the Vicarage; The Thirteen Problems; The\nBody in the Library; The Moving Finger; A Murder Is\nAnnounced; They Do It with Mirrors; A Pocket Full of Rye;\n4.50 from Paddington; The Mirror Crack\u2019d from Side to Side;\nA Caribbean Mystery; At Bertram\u2019s Hotel; Nemesis; Sleeping\nMurder; Miss Marple\u2019s Final Cases\n1.

Perhaps more surprising\nthan the revelation of the murderer is the detective who will\ncrack the case: \u2018a whitehaired old lady with a gentle,\nappealing manner.\u2019 Miss Jane Marple has arrived on the\nscene, and crime literature\u2019s private men\u2019s club of great\ndetectives will never be the same.\nSaturday Review of Literature: \u2018When she really hits her\nstride, as she does here, Agatha Christie is hard to\n\n----Page Break----\nsurpass.\u2019\n2. The Thirteen Problems (1932)\nOver six Tuesday evenings a group gathers at Miss Marple\u2019s\nhouse to ponder unsolved crimes. The company is inclined\nto forget their elderly hostess as they become mesmerized\nby the sinister tales they tell one another. But it is always\nMiss Marple\u2019s quiet genius that names the criminal or the\nmeans of the misdeed. As indeed is true in subsequent\ngatherings at the country home of Colonel and Mrs Bantry,\nwhere another set of terrible wrongs is related by the\nassembled guests\u2014and righted, by Miss Marple.\nThe stories: \u2018The Tuesday Night Club\u2019; \u2018The Idol House of\nAstarte\u2019; \u2018Ingots of Gold\u2019; \u2018The Bloodstained Pavement\u2019;\n\u2018Motive v Opportunity\u2019; \u2018The Thumb Mark of St Peter\u2019; \u2018The\nBlue Geranium\u2019; \u2018The Companion\u2019; \u2018The Four Suspects\u2019; \u2018A\nChristmas Tragedy\u2019; \u2018The Herb of Death\u2019; \u2018The A\ufb00air at the\nBungalow\u2019; \u2018Death by Drowning.\u2019\nDaily Mirror: \u2018The plots are so good that one marvels\u2026\nMost of them would have made a full-length thriller.\u2019\n3. The Body in the Library (1942)\nThe \nvery-respectable \nColonel \nand \nMrs \nBantry \nhave\nawakened to discover the body of a young woman in their\nlibrary. She is wearing evening dress and heavy make-up,\nwhich is now smeared across her cold cheeks. But who is\nshe? How did she get there? And what is her connection\nwith another dead girl, whose charred remains are later\ndiscovered in an abandoned quarry? The Bantrys turn to\nMiss Marple to solve the mystery.\nOf note: Many of the residents of St. Mary Mead, who\nappeared in the \ufb01rst full-length Miss Marple mystery twelve\n\n----Page Break----\nyears earlier, The Murder at the Vicarage, return in The\nBody in the Library. Mrs Christie wrote Body simultaneously\nwith the Tommy and Tuppence Beresford spy thriller N or\nM?, alternating between the two novels to keep herself, as\nshe put it, \u2018fresh at task.\u2019\nThe Times Literary Supplement wrote of this second\nMarple novel: \u2018It is hard not to be impressed.\u2019\n4. The Moving Finger (1943)\nLymstock is a town with more than its share of shameful\nsecrets\u2014a town where even a sudden outbreak of\nanonymous hate-mail causes only a minor stir. But all of\nthat changes when one of the recipients, Mrs Symmington,\nappears to have been driven to suicide. \u2018I can\u2019t go on,\u2019 her\n\ufb01nal note reads. Only Miss Marple questions the coroner\u2019s\nverdict. Was this the work of a poison pen? Or of a poisoner?\nOf note: The Moving Finger was a favourite of its author.\nFrom An Autobiography (1977): \u2018I \ufb01nd that\u2026I am really\npleased with\u2026The Moving Finger. It is a great test to reread\nwhat one has written some seventeen or eighteen years\nbefore. One\u2019s view changes. Some do not stand the test of\ntime, others do.\u2019\nThe Times: \u2018Beyond all doubt the puzzle in The Moving\nFinger is \ufb01t for the experts.\u2019\n5. A Murder Is Announced (1950)\nThe invitation spelled it out quite clearly: \u2018A murder is\nannounced and will take place on Friday, October 29th, at\nLittle Paddocks, at 6:30 p.m.\u2019 Everyone in town expected a\nsimple party game\u2014a secret \u2018murderer\u2019 is chosen, the lights\ngo out, the \u2018victim\u2019 falls, and the players guess \u2018whodunit.\u2019\nAmusing, indeed\u2014until a real corpse is discovered. A game\n\n----Page Break----\nas murderous as this requires the most brilliant player of all:\nJane Marple.\nRobert Barnard: \u2018As good as Agatha Christie ever wrote.\u2019\nA.A. Milne: \u2018Establishes \ufb01rmly her claim to the throne of\ndetection. The plot is as ingenious as ever\u2026the dialogue\nboth wise and witty; while the suspense is maintained\nvery skillfully\u2026\u2019\nThe New York Times Book Review: \u2018A super-smooth\nChristie\u2026neat \nmurders \nin \nan \nEnglish \nvillage\u2026an\nassortment of her famous red herrings, all beautifully\nmarinated.\u2019\n6. They Do It with Mirrors (1952)\nA sense of danger pervades the rambling Victorian mansion\nin which Jane Marple\u2019s friend Carrie Louise lives\u2014and not\nonly because the building doubles as a rehabilitation centre\nfor criminal youths. One inmate attempts, and fails, to shoot\ndead the administrator. But simultaneously, in another part\nof the building, a mysterious visitor is less lucky. Miss Marple\nmust employ all her cunning to solve the riddle of the\nstranger\u2019s visit, and his murder\u2014while protecting her friend\nfrom a similarly dreadful fate.\nGuardian: \u2018Brilliant.\u2019\nThe New York Times: \u2018No one on either side of the\nAtlantic does it better.\u2019\n7. A Pocket Full of Rye (1953)\nRex Fortescue, king of a \ufb01nancial empire, was sipping tea in\nhis \u2018counting house\u2019 when he su\ufb00ered an agonising and\nsudden death. The only clue to his murder: \u2018loose grain\u2019\nfound in his pocket. The murder seems without rhyme or\n\n----Page Break----\nreason\u2014until shrewd Jane Marple recalls that delightful\nnursery rhyme, \u2018Sing a Song of Sixpence.\u2019 A playful hint\nindeed for a murder that is anything but child\u2019s play.\nTimes Literary Supplement: \u2018Ingenious.\u2019\nThe New York Times: \u2018The best of the novels starring\nMiss Marple.\u2019\n8. 4.50 from Paddington (1957)\nFor an instant the two trains ran side by side. In that frozen\nmoment, Elspeth McGillicuddy stared helplessly out of her\ncarriage window as a man tightened his grip around a\nwoman\u2019s throat. The body crumpled. Then the other train\ndrew away. But who, apart from Mrs McGillicuddy\u2019s friend\nJane Marple, would take her story seriously? After all, there\nare no other witnesses, no suspects, and no case\u2014for there\nis no corpse, and no one is missing. Miss Marple asks her\nhighly \ne\ufb03cient \nand \nintelligent \nyoung \nfriend \nLucy\nEyelesbarrow to in\ufb01ltrate the Crackenthorpe family, who\nseem to be at the heart of the mystery, and help unmask a\nmurderer.\nOf note: The introduction of Lucy Eyelesbarrow as a side-\nkick to Miss Marple was lauded by the critics, but her work\nwith the older detective was limited to this novel.\n9. The Mirror Crack\u2019d from Side to Side (1962)\nThe quaint village of St. Mary Mead has been glamourized\nby the presence of screen queen Marina Gregg, who has\ntaken up residence in preparation for her comeback. But\nwhen a local fan is poisoned, Marina \ufb01nds herself starring in\na real-life mystery\u2014supported with scene-stealing aplomb\nby Jane Marple, who suspects that the lethal cocktail was\nintended for someone else. But who? If it was meant for\nMarina, then why? And before the \ufb01nal fade-out, who else\n\n----Page Break----\nfrom St. Mary Mead\u2019s cast of seemingly innocent characters\nis going to be eliminated?\nTimes Literary Supplement: \u2018The pieces\u2026drop into place\nwith a satisfying click. Agatha Christie deserves her\nfame.\u2019\n10. A Caribbean Mystery (1964)\nAs Jane Marple sat basking in the tropical sunshine she felt\nmildly discontented with life. True, the warmth eased her\nrheumatism, but here in paradise nothing ever happened.\nThen a question was put to her by a stranger: \u2018Would you\nlike to see a picture of a murderer?\u2019 Before she has a chance\nto answer, the man vanishes, only to be found dead the\nnext day. The mysteries abound: Where is the picture? Why\nis the hotelier prone to nightmares? Why doesn\u2019t the most\ntalked-about guest, a reclusive millionaire, ever leave his\nroom? And why is Miss Marple herself fearful for her life?\nOf note: A Caribbean Mystery introduces the wealthy (and\ndi\ufb03cult) Mr Jason Ra\ufb01el, who will call upon Miss Marple for\nhelp in Nemesis (1971)\u2014after his death.\nObserver: \n\u2018Liveliness\u2026infectious \nzest\u2026as \ngood \nas\nanything Mrs Christie has done.\u2019\nThe New York Times: \u2018Throws o\ufb00 the false clues and\nmisleading events as only a master of the art can do.\u2019\n11. At Bertram\u2019s Hotel (1965)\nWhen Jane Marple comes up from the country for a holiday\nin London, she \ufb01nds what she\u2019s looking for at Bertram\u2019s: a\nrestored London hotel with traditional decor, impeccable\nservice\u2014and an unmistakable atmosphere of danger behind\nthe highly polished veneer. Yet not even Miss Marple can\nforesee the violent chain of events set in motion when an\n\n----Page Break----\neccentric guest makes his way to the airport on the wrong\nday\u2026\nOf note: Bertram\u2019s was inspired by Brown\u2019s Hotel in London,\nwhere the author was a frequent visitor.\nSaturday Review of Literature: \u2018One of the author\u2019s very\nbest productions, with splendid pace, bright lines.\u2019\nThe New York Times: \u2018A joy to read from beginning to\nend, especially in its acute sensitivity to the contrasts\nbetween this era and that of Miss Marple\u2019s youth.\u2019\nThe New Yorker: \u2018Mrs Christie\u2019s pearly talent for dealing\nwith all the words and pomps that go with murder\nEnglish-style shimmers steadily in this tale of the noisy\nwoe that shatters the extremely expensive peace of\nBertram\u2019s famously old-fashioned hotel.\u2019\n12. Nemesis (1971)\nEven the un\ufb02appable Miss Marple is astounded as she reads\nthe letter addressed to her on instructions from the recently\ndeceased tycoon Mr Jason Ra\ufb01el, whom she had met on\nholiday \nin \nthe \nWest \nIndies \n(A \nCaribbean \nMystery).\nRecognising in her a natural \ufb02air for justice and a genius for\ncrime-solving, Mr Ra\ufb01el has bequeathed to Miss Marple a\n\u00a320,000 legacy\u2014and a legacy of an entirely di\ufb00erent sort.\nFor he has asked Miss Marple to investigate\u2026his own\nmurder. The only problem is, Mr Ra\ufb01el has failed to name a\nsuspect or suspects. And, whoever they are, they will\ncertainly be determined to thwart Miss Marple\u2019s inquiries\u2014\nno matter what it will take to stop her.\nOf note: Nemesis is the last Jane Marple mystery that\nAgatha \nChristie \nwrote\u2014though \nnot \nthe \nlast \nMarple\n\n----Page Break----\npublished.\nBest Sellers: \u2018The old charm is still there and a good\ndeal of the old magic in plotting, too.\u2019\nTimes Literary Supplement: \u2018Miss Marple is an old lady\nnow, knowing that a scent for evil is still, in the evening\nof her days, her peculiar gift.\u2019\n13. Sleeping Murder (1976)\nSoon after Gwenda Reed moves into her new home, odd\nthings start to happen. Despite her best e\ufb00orts to\nmodernise the house, she only succeeds in dredging up its\npast. Worse, she feels an irrational sense of terror every\ntime she climbs the stairs\u2026In fear, Gwenda turns to Jane\nMarple to exorcise her ghosts. Between them, they are to\nsolve a \u2018perfect\u2019 crime committed many years before\u2026\nOf note: Agatha Christie wrote Sleeping Murder during World\nWar II and had it placed in a bank vault for over thirty years.\nChicago Tribune: \u2018Agatha Christie saved the best for\nlast.\u2019\nSunday Express: \u2018A puzzle that is tortuous, surprising,\nand\u2026satisfying.\u2019\n14. Miss Marple\u2019s Final Cases (1979)\nDespite the title, the stories collected here recount cases\nfrom the middle of Miss. Marple\u2019s career. They are:\n\u2018Sanctuary\u2019; \u2018Strange Jest\u2019; \u2018Tape-Measure Murder\u2019; \u2018The\nCase of the Caretaker\u2019; \u2018The Case of the Perfect Maid\u2019; \u2018Miss\nMarple Tells a Story\u2019; \u2018The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll\u2019; \u2018In a Glass\nDarkly\u2019; \u2018Greenshaw\u2019s Folly.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nThe Republican (Spring\ufb01eld, Massachusetts): \u2018When it all\nbecomes clear as day, the reader can only say, \u201cNow\nwhy didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d But he never does. Mrs\nChristie at her best.\u2019\n\n----Page Break----\nCharles Osborne on Miss Marple\u2019s Final Cases\nMiss Marple Short Stories (1979)\nMiss Marple\u2019s Final Cases and two other stories was\npublished in the UK only, for the stories were already\navailable in other volumes published in the USA. Two of the\nstories, \u2018The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll\u2019 and \u2018Sanctuary\u2019, are to be\nfound in Double Sin (1961: see p. 301); four stories,\n\u2018Strange Jest\u2019, \u2018Tape Measure Murder\u2019, \u2018The Case of the\nPerfect Maid\u2019 and \u2018The Case of the Caretaker\u2019, are from\nThree Blind Mice (1950: see p. 237); and the remaining two\nstories, \u2018Miss Marple Tells a Story\u2019 and \u2018In a Glass Darkly\u2019,\ncome from The Regatta Mystery (1939: see p. 175).\nOf the eight stories, two (\u2018The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll\u2019 and \u2018In\na Glass Darkly\u2019) are not Miss Marple adventures. The\nremaining six ought not really to have been called Miss\nMarple\u2019s Final Cases, for they are examples of that\nredoubtable lady in mid-career. The publisher\u2019s justi\ufb01cation\nfor putting together a collection of them was that, although\nthey had appeared in magazines in the past, the stories\nwere being published in volume form for the \ufb01rst time in\nGreat Britain. A statement to this e\ufb00ect appeared in the\n\u2018blurb\u2019 on the inside of the front jacket. It is, however,\nslightly inaccurate, for \u2018Tape-Measure Murder\u2019 had found its\nway into Thirteen for Luck, \u2018a selection of mystery stories for\nyoung readers\u2019 which Collins had published in 1966.\n\n----Page Break----\nProblem at Pollensa Bay\nAbout Charles Osborne\nThis essay was adapted from Charles Osborne\u2019s The Life and\nCrimes of Agatha Christie: A Biographical Companion to the\nWorks of Agatha Christie (1982, rev. 1999). Mr. Osborne was\nborn in Brisbane in 1927. He is known internationally as an\nauthority on opera, and has written a number of books on\nmusical and literary subjects, among them The Complete\nOperas of Verdi (1969); Wagner and His World (1977); and\nW.H. Auden: The Life of a Poet (1980). An addict of crime\n\ufb01ction and the world\u2019s leading authority on Agatha Christie,\nCharles Osborne adapted the Christie plays Black Co\ufb00ee\n(Poirot); Spider\u2019s Web; and The Unexpected Guest into\nnovels. He lives in London.\n\n----Page Break----\nAbout Agatha Christie\nAgatha Christie is known throughout the world as the Queen\nof Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in\nEnglish and another billion in 100 foreign languages. She is\nthe most widely published author of all time and in any\nlanguage, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare. Mrs\nChristie is the author of eighty crime novels and short story\ncollections, nineteen plays, and six novels written under the\nname of Mary Westmacott.\nAgatha Christie\u2019s \ufb01rst novel, The Mysterious A\ufb00air at\nStyles, was written towards the end of World War I (during\nwhich she served in the Voluntary Aid Detachments). In it\nshe created Hercule Poirot, the little Belgian investigator\nwho was destined to become the most popular detective in\ncrime \ufb01ction since Sherlock Holmes. After having been\nrejected by a number of houses, The Mysterious A\ufb00air at\nStyles was eventually published by The Bodley Head in\n1920.\nIn 1926, now averaging a book a year, Agatha Christie\nwrote her masterpiece. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was\nthe \ufb01rst of her books to be published by William Collins and\nmarked the beginning of an author-publisher relationship\nthat lasted for \ufb01fty years and produced over seventy books.\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd was also the \ufb01rst of Agatha\nChristie\u2019s works to be dramatised\u2014as Alibi\u2014and to have a\nsuccessful run in London\u2019s West End. The Mousetrap, her\n\n----Page Break----\nmost famous play, opened in 1952 and runs to this day at St\nMartin\u2019s Theatre in the West End; it is the longest-running\nplay in history.\nAgatha Christie was made a Dame in 1971. She died in\n1976, since when a number of her books have been\npublished: the bestselling novel Sleeping Murder appeared\nin 1976, followed by An Autobiography and the short story\ncollections Miss Marple\u2019s Final Cases; Problem at Pollensa\nBay; and While the Light Lasts.

While titled \"Final Cases,\" these stories actually represent Miss Marple's adventures from mid-career, offering a delightful glimpse into her astute mind and village wisdom. Alongside the stories, the document includes insightful essays about Miss Marple and Agatha Christie herself, enhancing the reader's appreciation of this timeless character and her creator.\n\n*\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f *Short Story Summaries:* \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f*\n\n*1\ufe0f\u20e3 *Sanctuary:*\n_Summary:_  Bunch Harmon, the vicar's wife, discovers a dying man in the church. His only word, whispered twice before passing away, is \"Sanctuary.\"  This mystery revolves around uncovering the man's identity and the reason he sought refuge in the church. The police initially believe it's a suicide, but Bunch, with her sharp intuition, suspects foul play and the meaning behind \"sanctuary\" becomes central to unraveling the truth.\n\n_Elaboration:_  The story kicks off with classic Christie village charm, personified by the endearing Bunch Harmon. The seemingly simple case of a suicide quickly becomes more complex as Bunch's observations and the dying man's enigmatic word \"sanctuary\" raise questions.  The limited clues, a wallet, a watch with initials W.S. and a return ticket, are typical Christie red herrings. The introduction of the supposed relatives, Mr. and Mrs. Eccles, and their suspicious behavior, further thickens the plot.  The story cleverly blends the peaceful setting of a village church with the grim reality of a murder mystery, setting the tone for Miss Marple's subtle yet incisive investigation, eventually revealing a past crime and hidden jewels.\n\n*2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Strange Jest:*\n_Summary:_  Young cousins Charmian Stroud and Edward Rossiter inherit \"practically nothing\" from their wealthy Great-Great-Uncle Mathew. However, a cryptic deathbed message involving winking and the word \"doves\" leads them to believe a hidden treasure exists at Ansteys, the family estate.  Desperate to save Ansteys from being sold, they enlist Miss Marple's help to decipher Uncle Mathew's strange jest and locate the hidden fortune.\n\n_Elaboration:_  \"Strange Jest\" embodies the classic treasure hunt trope with a delightful Christie twist.  The initial setup of the impoverished heirs and the eccentric uncle is instantly engaging. The clues are cleverly embedded in seemingly nonsensical ramblings and a bizarre recipe for baked ham. Miss Marple's method of deduction is showcased as she focuses on the uncle's personality and fondness for puns rather than complex codes. The story humorously satirizes the idea of buried gold bullion, revealing a much more ingenious and characteristically Christie solution involving rare stamps hidden within old letters, demonstrating that true treasure isn't always what it seems.\n\n*3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Tape-Measure Murder:*\n_Summary:_ Dressmaker Miss Politt arrives at Laburnum Cottage for a fitting with Mrs. Spenlow but finds no answer.  Miss Hartnell, a neighbor, investigates and discovers Mrs. Spenlow dead. Initially, suspicion falls on Mr. Spenlow, but Miss Marple, observing seemingly insignificant details like a dressmaker's pin near the body, suspects a more cunning killer: Miss Politt herself.\n\n_Elaboration:_  This story is a masterclass in observation and the importance of seemingly trivial details. Miss Marple's deduction hinges on a common dressmaking pin, an object easily overlooked by others. The story cleverly utilizes the setting of a quiet village and the mundane profession of a dressmaker to conceal a dark secret. The motive is rooted in a past jewel robbery, highlighting Christie's recurring theme of past crimes casting long shadows. The story showcases Miss Marple's ability to see beyond the obvious and connect seemingly disparate clues, ultimately revealing a motive based on greed and fear of exposure.\n\n*4\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Case of the Caretaker:*\n_Summary:_ Doctor Haydock presents Miss Marple with a manuscript detailing a recent tragedy: the death of Louise Laxton after being thrown from her horse, seemingly spooked by the caretaker's widow, Mrs. Murgatroyd, who had been cursing the Laxtons.  Miss Marple must unravel the truth behind the \"accident,\" considering the motives of various characters, including the husband, Harry Laxton, and his past relationship with another woman.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"The Case of the Caretaker\" is presented as a puzzle for Miss Marple to solve, mirroring the reader's own detective journey. The story delves into village gossip and suspicion, highlighting the themes of jealousy and greed. Mrs. Murgatroyd's dramatic cursing acts as a red herring, diverting attention from the true killer. Miss Marple's keen insight into human nature and her understanding of typical motivations lead her to the real culprit, exposing a carefully orchestrated murder plot motivated by money and a desire for a new love, concealed beneath a veneer of grief and coincidence.\n\n*5\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Case of the Perfect Maid:*\n_Summary:_  Rumors swirl around Gladys Holmes, a maid dismissed for suspected theft.  However, when a new maid, Mary Higgins, arrives and proves to be \"too good to be true,\" Miss Marple becomes suspicious.  A series of thefts at Old Hall, where Mary works, confirms Miss Marple's intuition, leading her to uncover a clever scheme involving impersonation and deception.\n\n_Elaboration:_  \"The Case of the Perfect Maid\" explores the theme of appearances being deceptive.  Mary Higgins, initially lauded as a paragon of domestic virtue, turns out to be a cunning thief. Miss Marple's suspicion is aroused by the maid's flawless persona and the exaggerated praise from her employers. The story cleverly uses the social context of domestic service and the expectations surrounding maids to create a believable disguise for the criminal. Miss Marple's observation of minor inconsistencies and her understanding of human fallibility enable her to pierce through the facade of perfection and expose the truth.\n\n*6\ufe0f\u20e3 *Miss Marple Tells a Story:*\n_Summary:_  Mr. Petherick, a solicitor, seeks Miss Marple's help in a baffling murder case. A woman, Mrs. Rhodes, is found stabbed in a hotel room, seemingly impossible for anyone to have entered or left unseen. Suspicion falls on her husband, but Miss Marple, through keen observation and understanding of human behavior, proposes an ingenious solution involving a clever disguise and misdirection.\n\n_Elaboration:_  \"Miss Marple Tells a Story\" is a classic locked-room mystery, showcasing Christie's brilliance in crafting intricate plots.  The seemingly impossible crime scene and the limited suspects create a compelling puzzle. Miss Marple's methodically analyzes the facts, focusing on the witness testimonies and the overlooked detail of the chambermaid's appearance. Her deduction hinges on the concept of misdirection and the power of assumption, revealing a murderer who cleverly exploited the mundane and the expected, using a disguise to commit the crime in plain sight.\n\n*7\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll:*\n_Summary:_  At a London dressmaking shop, a velvet doll mysteriously appears in the fitting room and begins to move around on its own, unsettling the staff.  The doll's presence becomes increasingly unnerving, creating an atmosphere of unease and fear until the doll is dramatically thrown out the window, only to be reclaimed by a child, suggesting a possible desire for love behind the uncanny events.\n\n_Elaboration:_  \"The Dressmaker's Doll\" is a departure from the typical murder mystery, leaning more towards the suspenseful and slightly supernatural. The story explores themes of fear, the uncanny, and the power of suggestion. The doll's unexplained movements create a growing sense of dread and paranoia among the characters. While not a traditional crime, the story builds suspense and explores the psychological impact of the unexplained. The ambiguous ending, with the child claiming the doll desires love, leaves the reader pondering the true nature of the doll's unsettling presence and whether it was truly malevolent or simply misunderstood.\n\n*8\ufe0f\u20e3 *In A Glass Darkly:*\n_Summary:_  A young man, while dressing for dinner, sees a terrifying vision in his mirror: a girl being strangled in a room behind him.  Later, he meets the girl from his vision and her fianc\u00e9, a man with a scar matching the one he saw in the mirror.  Years later, he recounts the story, reflecting on whether his vision was prophetic and how his actions, based on this vision, altered the course of lives.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"In A Glass Darkly\" delves into the realm of the premonition and the supernatural, a less common theme in Miss Marple stories, yet still explored through a rational lens. The story questions the nature of reality and perception, and the potential for psychic glimpses into the future. The protagonist's dilemma of whether to act on his vision and intervene in Sylvia's engagement creates suspense.  The story ultimately reveals a more grounded explanation, but the initial premise of the vision and its impact on the characters' lives adds a layer of psychological intrigue and questions of fate versus free will.\n\n*9\ufe0f\u20e3 *Greenshaw\u2019s Folly:*\n_Summary:_  Raymond West and his friend Horace Bindler visit Greenshaw's Folly, an eccentric mansion, where they meet Miss Greenshaw.  She asks them to witness her will, leaving her estate to her housekeeper, Mrs. Cresswell. Soon after, Miss Greenshaw is murdered with an arrow.  Miss Marple must unravel the complex family history and motives of various individuals to solve the seemingly impossible crime.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Greenshaw's Folly\" returns to the classic country house murder setting, rich with family secrets and hidden motives. The eccentric Miss Greenshaw and the imposing mansion provide a vivid backdrop for the mystery. The initial focus on the will and the housekeeper as the beneficiary creates immediate suspicion.  However, Miss Marple's investigation delves deeper into the family's past, revealing illegitimate lineage and a carefully plotted crime involving impersonation and misdirection, ultimately exposing a scheme to inherit the Greenshaw fortune through a calculated murder disguised as an accident.\n\n*\ud83d\udcda *E-Book Extras: Insights and Context* \ud83d\udcda*\n\n*Charles Osborne's Essay: \"The Marples\"*\n_Summary:_ Osborne's essay provides an overview of the Miss Marple series, highlighting key novels and short story collections.

A man lies huddled and dying on the chancel steps of the cold, unheated church.  His feeble pulse and greenish pallor speak of imminent death.  Bunch, a practical and observant woman, quickly assesses the situation. The man, dressed in a shabby dark suit, clutches a wad of handkerchief to his chest, around which dark brown stains, clearly dried blood, are visible.  As Bunch kneels beside him, his eyes flutter open, fixating on her face with surprising clarity.  In a weak voice, he utters a single, impactful word: \"Sanctuary.\" He repeats it once more, a faint smile accompanying the plea, before his eyes close again, and his breath becomes shallow.  Bunch, realizing the gravity of the situation, leaves the church to seek help from Dr. Griffiths, setting in motion a chain of events that unveils a mystery far deeper than a simple suicide. The police, initially inclined to see it as self-inflicted, are soon confronted with the complexities of the man's identity, his last word, and the suspicious behavior of those who claim to be his family. Miss Marple, though not physically present, is instrumental in guiding Bunch's astute observations, leading to the uncovering of a jewel heist and a desperate man's final plea for refuge.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Sanctuary\" masterfully sets the stage with the contrast between the serenity of a village church and the intrusion of violence and death. Bunch Harmon, the vicar's wife, is immediately established as a key figure \u2013 not a detective herself, but possessing the sharp eyes and common sense that Miss Marple often relies on in others.  The story is rich in atmosphere, vividly portraying the damp November air and the chilly darkness of the unheated church.  The dying man's cryptic utterance, \"Sanctuary,\" becomes the central enigma, a word pregnant with meaning and historical weight.  The initial investigation by Sergeant Hayes focuses on the obvious: the man's pockets yield a wallet, a watch with initials \"W.S.\", and a return ticket to London, suggesting a possible suicide of a depressed individual.  However, Bunch's intuition, honed by village life and a keen understanding of human nature (traits mirroring Miss Marple's own), questions the simplicity of this explanation.  The arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Eccles, claiming to be the man's sister and brother-in-law, introduces a layer of suspicion. Their eagerness to claim the deceased's belongings, particularly his coat, and their relief when told he left no message beyond \"Sanctuary,\" raises red flags for Bunch.\n\nThe watch, engraved \"To Walter from his father,\" contradicts Mrs. Eccles's consistent use of \"William\" or \"Bill\" when referring to her supposed brother, Walter Sandbourne. This discrepancy, noticed by Bunch, becomes a crucial clue.  Bunch's visit to Miss Marple in London solidifies her suspicions. Miss Marple, despite her physical absence from the village, acts as the guiding intellect, prompting Bunch to articulate her doubts and directing her towards the crucial piece of evidence \u2013 the coat. Bunch's cleverness in discovering the hidden cloakroom ticket within the coat lining, a detail missed by the supposed relatives, is a testament to her own developing detective skills, fostered by her association with Miss Marple (even indirectly).  The cloakroom ticket leads to a suitcase at Paddington Station, containing not personal papers, as the Eccleses might have hoped, but theatrical costumes adorned with real emeralds.\n\nThe story then unravels the backstory of Walter St. John, an escaped convict who was once connected to a famous jewel robbery involving a dancer named Zobeida and her emerald necklace.  His dying word \"Sanctuary\" takes on a new layer of meaning - not just refuge from his pursuers (the Eccleses/Moss), but also a spiritual sanctuary sought in the church as he faced death.  The Eccleses, revealed to be jewel thieves themselves, were after the jewels they believed Sandbourne (actually St. John/Walter) had taken.  The twist is that the jewels weren't stolen, but were Zobeida's own, cleverly hidden within her costumes. Walter St. John, Zobeida's widower, was trying to secure them for their daughter, Jewel, whose guardians in Chipping Cleghorn were facing hardship. The \"please\" he uttered to Bunch before dying was a plea for help for his daughter.  \"Sanctuary\" culminates in a poignant resolution where the jewels, initially sought for greed, are ultimately used to secure the future of the innocent child, Jewel, fulfilling the dying man's last wish and bringing a different kind of sanctuary \u2013 safety and security \u2013 to his daughter. The story beautifully blends suspense, village charm, and a touch of pathos, showcasing Miss Marple's wisdom working through the observant Bunch Harmon.\n\n*2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Strange Jest: Unraveling the Riddle* \ud83e\udde9*\n\n_Summary:_ Charmian Stroud and Edward Rossiter, cousins and the sole heirs of their eccentric Great-Great-Uncle Mathew, are left bewildered and practically penniless after his death.  Uncle Mathew, known for his wealth and growing suspicion of banks and financial institutions, had often declared his intention to bury his fortune.  His will, however, reveals a startling lack of assets.  Charmian and Edward, deeply fond of Ansteys, the family estate they are poised to inherit, are devastated at the prospect of having to sell it.  They are further intrigued by Uncle Mathew's cryptic last words: \"You'll be all right, my pretty pair of doves,\" accompanied by a wink and a tap on his right eye.  Interpreting this as a clue to his hidden wealth, they embark on a frantic treasure hunt, tearing apart the house and grounds of Ansteys in a desperate search.  Exhausted and disheartened, they seek help from Jane Helier, a mutual friend, who introduces them to Miss Marple, holding her up as a solver of mysteries extraordinaire.  Initially skeptical, Charmian and Edward are soon captivated by Miss Marple's astute mind and her unconventional approach to deciphering their uncle's \"strange jest.\"\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Strange Jest\" is a lighthearted yet cleverly constructed mystery that plays on the classic trope of buried treasure.  The opening establishes the charming but financially precarious situation of Charmian and Edward, making the reader immediately sympathetic to their plight. Uncle Mathew is portrayed as a whimsical eccentric, adding a layer of playful intrigue to the mystery. His distrust of modern finance and his pronouncements about burying treasure are deliberately misleading, setting up the \"strange jest\" of the title.  The cousins' exhaustive and ultimately fruitless search of Ansteys highlights their desperation and lack of direction, emphasizing their need for Miss Marple's guidance.  Miss Marple, despite initial skepticism from the younger generation, quickly demonstrates her unique detective prowess.  She doesn't immediately jump to physical clues or complex codes, but instead focuses on understanding Uncle Mathew's character.  Her seemingly rambling anecdotes about her own Uncle Henry, initially appearing irrelevant and even irritating to Charmian and Edward, are, in fact, crucial to her deduction.\n\nMiss Marple's analysis of Uncle Mathew as a man fond of \"obvious jokes,\" puns, and teasing, shifts the focus from a literal treasure hunt to a more metaphorical and intellectual puzzle.  Her insight that Uncle Mathew's talk of buried gold was likely a \"blind\" is key to redirecting the investigation.  The discovery of the secret drawer in Uncle Mathew's desk, prompted by Miss Marple's suggestion, appears initially to be another dead end, containing only love letters and a recipe for baked ham.  However, Miss Marple's sharp eye and understanding of wordplay lead her to the crucial clue within the signature of the love letters: \"Betty Martin.\"  She connects this to the common expression \"All my eye and Betty Martin,\" meaning nonsense, revealing that the letters themselves are a diversion. The letters, seemingly old, are revealed to be fakes, written much later by Uncle Mathew himself.  Miss Marple then focuses on the postmark date on the envelopes, 1851, and recalls her stamp-collecting great-nephew's knowledge of rare stamps, particularly an 1851 blue two-cent stamp.  This leads to the brilliant realization that the \"treasure\" is not buried gold or jewels, but valuable postage stamps hidden within the seemingly worthless love letters. The \"strange jest\" is Uncle Mathew's playful way of revealing the location of his hidden wealth, relying on his relatives' intelligence and wit to decipher his riddle.  The story concludes with the cousins' delighted discovery of the stamps and their newfound financial security, allowing them to save Ansteys and embark on their married life, all thanks to Miss Marple's unconventional but ultimately effective detective methods, proving that the greatest treasures are not always buried, but sometimes hidden in plain sight, veiled by a \"strange jest.\"\n\n*3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Tape-Measure Murder: The Devil in the Details* \ud83d\udcd0*\n\n_Summary:_ In the quaint village of St. Mary Mead, Miss Politt, the local dressmaker, arrives at Laburnum Cottage for a fitting appointment with Mrs. Spenlow.  Finding no answer, she seeks the help of Miss Hartnell, a boisterous and assertive neighbor.  Miss Hartnell's loud knocking and peering through the window lead to a horrifying discovery: Mrs. Spenlow lies lifeless on the hearthrug.  The initial investigation focuses on Mr. Spenlow, the husband, whose seemingly detached demeanor and financial gain upon his wife's death make him the prime suspect in the eyes of the local police, particularly Inspector Slack.  However, Miss Marple, observing from her home next door, takes a different view.  A seemingly insignificant detail \u2013 a dressmaker's pin near Mrs. Spenlow's body \u2013 catches her attention, leading her to suspect Miss Politt, the dressmaker herself, and to unravel a crime rooted in a decades-old jewel robbery.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Tape-Measure Murder\" is a meticulously crafted story that exemplifies Christie's skill in building suspense through subtle clues and misdirection. The story opens with the mundane routine of a dressmaker's fitting, quickly disrupted by the shocking discovery of Mrs. Spenlow's murder.  The village setting of St. Mary Mead, usually associated with tranquility, is once again disturbed by violent crime, highlighting the contrast Christie often employs.  The initial suspicion directed towards Mr. Spenlow is a classic red herring, fueled by his unemotional reaction and the financial motive.  Inspector Slack, a characteristically confident but somewhat unimaginative policeman, readily accepts the husband as the prime suspect, overlooking more subtle clues.  Miss Marple, in contrast, with her keen eye for detail and her understanding of human nature, focuses on the seemingly insignificant pin.  This pin, a common dressmaker's tool, becomes the linchpin of her deduction, pointing directly to Miss Politt.\n\nMiss Marple's investigation is subtle and observational.  She engages Constable Palk, the local village policeman, in conversation, ostensibly about pins in general, but subtly guiding him to recall the pin he found at the crime scene.  Her visit to Miss Politt's residence, under the guise of altering an old dress, is a clever pretext to gather further information and observe the dressmaker's demeanor.  The story cleverly weaves in the backstory of Mrs. Spenlow's past as a between-maid at Sir Robert Abercrombie's place, where a valuable emerald necklace was stolen years ago. This past crime becomes crucial to understanding the motive.  Miss Marple's deduction hinges on the realization that Mrs. Spenlow was wearing a kimono, not a dress, suggesting she was preparing for a fitting. This detail, combined with the dressmaker's pin, leads Miss Marple to the conclusion that Miss Politt strangled Mrs. Spenlow with her own tape measure during the fitting, a crime of opportunity born from a long-held secret and fear of exposure.\n\nThe motive is revealed to be rooted in the old jewel robbery.  Mrs. Spenlow, the former tweeny-maid, and Miss Politt, the former lady's maid at Abercrombie's, were accomplices in the theft. Mrs. Spenlow had prospered, while Miss Politt remained in a humbler position, possibly harboring resentment.  The arrival of Ted Gerard, a young man associated with a religious group, and his influence on Mrs. Spenlow's conscience, becomes the catalyst for murder.  Miss Marple deduces that Mrs. Spenlow, under Gerard's influence, was likely considering confessing to her past crime, a prospect that terrified Miss Politt, leading her to commit murder to silence her former accomplice and protect her own freedom.  The story concludes with Miss Politt's arrest, her motive and method exposed by Miss Marple's astute observation of a seemingly trivial detail \u2013 a dressmaker's pin \u2013 proving that in crime, as in dressmaking, the smallest details can hold the key to the perfect fit, or in this case, the perfect murder.\n\n*4\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Case of the Caretaker: Unmasking Deception* \ud83c\udfad*\n\n_Summary:_ Dr. Haydock, concerned for Miss Marple's post-flu depression, presents her with a manuscript \u2013 a real-life puzzle he has written, hoping it will stimulate her mind.  The manuscript details the tragic death of Louise Laxton, who was thrown from her horse, seemingly frightened by the curses of old Mrs. Murgatroyd, the former caretaker of Kingsdean House.  While the incident is initially deemed an accident, Miss Marple, through Dr. Haydock's manuscript, begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding Louise's death, focusing on the motives and behaviors of various characters, particularly the bereaved husband, Harry Laxton, and his complex relationships with others in the village.  The story unfolds through Miss Marple's analytical mind as she pieces together clues from the manuscript, uncovering a web of deceit and revealing a calculated murder plot masked as a tragic accident.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"The Case of the Caretaker\" is unique in its presentation as a manuscript puzzle, directly involving Miss Marple as the reader and detective.  Dr. Haydock's manuscript acts as a narrative device, presenting the facts of the case and allowing Miss Marple (and the reader) to engage in armchair detection. The story is set in the context of village life, with its close-knit community, gossip, and underlying tensions.  The characters are vividly drawn: Harry Laxton, the charming but potentially unscrupulous husband; Louise, the wealthy and somewhat naive bride haunted by superstition; Clarice Vane, the doctor's niece and Louise's new friend; Bella Edge, Harry's former flame; and the menacing Mrs. Murgatroyd, the seemingly crazed caretaker's widow.  The narrative initially focuses on Mrs. Murgatroyd's strange behavior, her curses and threats, making her appear as the obvious catalyst, if not directly responsible, for Louise's death.  This sets up a classic red herring, drawing attention away from the true killer.\n\nMiss Marple's deduction begins with questioning the caretaker's motive.  Mrs. Murgatroyd's behavior seems exaggerated and theatrical, inconsistent with genuine grief or resentment.  This leads Miss Marple to suspect bribery and a staged performance.  She considers the relationships between the characters, particularly Harry Laxton's past affair with Bella Edge and his current marriage to the wealthy Louise.  The motive of greed and the possibility of Harry wanting to inherit Louise's fortune and reunite with Bella become apparent.  The introduction of Clarice Vane as a close friend to both Harry and Louise adds another layer of complexity.  Miss Marple, through the manuscript's details, observes Harry's calculated actions, his seemingly genuine grief, and his attempts to deflect suspicion onto Mrs. Murgatroyd.  The key to solving the puzzle is a seemingly insignificant detail \u2013 the hypodermic syringe found in Harry's pocket by Dr. Haydock after Louise's death. This detail, absent from the initial manuscript presented to Miss Marple but revealed later by Dr. Haydock, becomes the crucial piece of evidence.\n\nMiss Marple connects the syringe to the drug strophanthin and deduces that Harry murdered Louise, not through the horse accident, but by administering a fatal dose of the drug, ensuring her death was attributed to her injuries.  The horse accident, witnessed by the bakers, and Mrs. Murgatroyd's cursing were carefully staged elements of Harry's elaborate plan to create a seemingly accidental death and divert suspicion.  Bella Edge's confession to obtaining the strophanthin for Harry and Mrs. Murgatroyd's admission of being bribed to play her cursing role confirm Miss Marple's deductions.  The story concludes with the exposure of Harry's calculated and cold-blooded murder plot, motivated by greed and a desire to marry Clarice, revealing the dark undercurrents beneath the surface of village life and the manipulative nature of a charming but ruthless killer, all revealed through Miss Marple's astute reading of Dr. Haydock's manuscript and her insightful understanding of human motivation and deception.\n\n*5\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Case of the Perfect Maid: Cracks in Perfection* \ud83e\ude9e*\n\n_Summary:_ Edna, Miss Marple's maid, seeks her mistress's help for her cousin, Gladys, who was dismissed from her position with the Misses Skinner due to a missing brooch incident.  While Miss Marple initially dismisses it, she becomes intrigued when the Skinners hire a new maid, Mary Higgins, who is lauded as \"perfect.\"  Mary's exceptional skills and flawless demeanor strike Miss Marple as suspicious.  Soon after Mary's arrival, a series of jewel thefts plague the residents of Old Hall, where the Skinners reside.  Miss Marple, sensing a connection, begins to investigate, suspecting that the \"perfect maid\" may be far from what she seems, and that Gladys's dismissal might be more sinister than it appears.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"The Case of the Perfect Maid\" explores the deceptive nature of appearances and the dangers of judging by surface impressions.  The story begins with the seemingly mundane issue of a dismissed maid and a missing brooch, typical village gossip fodder.  Gladys Holmes, despite her \"bouncing, self-opinionated\" nature, is established as intrinsically honest, making her dismissal seem unjust.  The introduction of Mary Higgins, the \"perfect maid,\" immediately raises suspicion for Miss Marple.  Her perfection, her flawless references, and her ability to effortlessly manage the demanding Miss Emily Skinner, are all red flags for the astute elderly sleuth.  Miss Marple's suspicion is rooted in her understanding that true perfection is often unattainable and that appearances can be deliberately misleading, especially when they seem too good to be true.\n\nThe series of thefts at Old Hall, targeting various residents, including the Skinners themselves, confirms Miss Marple's intuition.  The thefts are carried out with professional precision, suggesting an inside job.  Miss Marple's investigation is subtle and observational.  She visits Old Hall, ostensibly to recruit stall-holders for the vicarage fete, but primarily to observe Mary Higgins firsthand.  She notes Mary's impeccable demeanor, her almost too-perfect efficiency, and her ability to anticipate every need.  A seemingly accidental encounter where Miss Marple drops her bag, scattering its contents, provides a crucial opportunity.  Mary's handling of the items, particularly a sticky piece of rock candy and a mirror, allows Miss Marple to cleverly obtain Mary's fingerprints, a key piece of evidence.  Miss Marple's insight that \"paragons\" are rare and often deceptive drives her investigation.  She realizes that Mary Higgins is not who she claims to be and that her perfection is a carefully constructed facade.\n\nThe story culminates in the revelation that Mary Higgins is a fraud, a professional thief who used the guise of a perfect maid to gain access to Old Hall and its residents' valuables.  Miss Marple's cleverness in obtaining fingerprints and her astute deduction that Miss Emily Skinner, the hypochondriac sister, and Mary Higgins were never seen together, lead her to the shocking truth.  Miss Emily and Mary Higgins are the same person, a cunning thief who impersonated a frail invalid and a perfect maid to orchestrate the robberies.  Miss Lavinia, blinded by her desire for a perfect servant and her belief in her sister's illness, is completely deceived.  The story highlights the dangers of superficial judgments and the importance of looking beyond appearances to uncover the truth, proving that even in the most tranquil village settings, deception and criminality can lurk beneath a veneer of perfection.  Gladys Holmes is exonerated, her honesty vindicated by Miss Marple's keen observation and unwavering pursuit of the truth, restoring her reputation and highlighting the injustice of snap judgments based on appearances.\n\n*6\ufe0f\u20e3 *Miss Marple Tells a Story: The Illusion of Impossibility* \ud83d\udeaa*\n\n_Summary:_  Solicitor Mr. Petherick seeks Miss Marple's unique perspective on a perplexing murder case that has baffled even Scotland Yard.  The victim, Mrs. Rhodes, was found stabbed to death in her locked hotel room.  Her husband, Mr. Rhodes, is the prime suspect, but insists on his innocence.  The room was seemingly impenetrable, with the only other door locked from the inside and the window latched. Witnesses confirm that no one entered or left the room during the crucial timeframe, except for a chambermaid.  Miss Marple, intrigued by the seemingly impossible nature of the crime, listens intently to Mr. Petherick's account, focusing on the details of the hotel layout and the testimonies of the witnesses, searching for the flaw in the seemingly airtight scenario.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Miss Marple Tells a Story\" is a classic locked-room mystery, a subgenre Agatha Christie excels in.  The story immediately presents an intriguing puzzle: a murder committed in a room seemingly impossible to enter or leave undetected.  The limited suspects and the seemingly airtight alibis create a compelling challenge for Miss Marple (and the reader). Mr. Rhodes, initially presented as the most likely culprit, is portrayed as somewhat hapless and bewildered, making his guilt less certain.  The focus shifts to the seemingly impossible logistics of the crime. The hotel setting, with its corridors, connecting rooms, and various witnesses, becomes a crucial element in the puzzle.  Miss Marple's method of deduction is characteristically methodical and insightful.  She doesn't rely on complex forensic analysis or elaborate theories, but instead focuses on the human element, questioning the witnesses' perceptions and assumptions.\n\nMiss Marple's key insight lies in questioning the description of the chambermaid.  She asks Mr. Petherick and Mr. Rhodes to describe the chambermaid, revealing their vague and indistinct recollections. This leads her to the crucial realization that the witnesses likely focused on the \"chambermaid's uniform\" rather than the individual woman wearing it.  She proposes the ingenious solution that the murderer disguised themselves as a chambermaid, exploiting the fact that witnesses would subconsciously register the uniform and not necessarily the person underneath it.  This disguise allowed the murderer to enter and leave Mrs. Rhodes's room in plain sight, unnoticed as an intruder.  The locked-room aspect is explained by the murderer entering through Mr. Rhodes's connecting room, committing the murder, locking the door from Mrs. Rhodes's room to the hallway from the inside, and then exiting back through Mr. Rhodes's room, all while disguised as the seemingly innocuous chambermaid.\n\nThe motive is revealed to be revenge. Miss Carruthers, using a false name and disguise, was driven by insanity stemming from the accidental death of her child, caused by Mrs. Rhodes's reckless driving.  Her elaborate plan, meticulously executed, was motivated by a desire for vengeance, cleverly exploiting the mundane and the expected to commit an almost \"invisible\" murder.  Miss Marple's deduction, based on keen observation and understanding of human perception and misdirection, solves the seemingly impossible crime, highlighting her brilliance in seeing beyond the obvious and uncovering the truth hidden in plain sight, proving that even the most impenetrable locks can be circumvented by human ingenuity and deception.\n\n*7\ufe0f\u20e3 *The Dressmaker\u2019s Doll:  Uncanny Presence* \ud83e\ude9e*\n\n_Summary:_ In a chic London dressmaking salon, a life-sized velvet doll mysteriously appears in the fitting room.  Initially unnoticed, the doll gradually begins to unsettle the staff and owner, Miss Coombe, as it seems to move around the room on its own \u2013 sitting at the desk, appearing on the window sill, changing positions on the sofa.  The doll's uncanny presence creates an atmosphere of unease and fear, disrupting the shop's routine and impacting the women's work.  The story follows the growing anxiety and bewilderment of Sybil Fox, Miss Coombe's assistant, and Mrs. Groves, the cleaner, as they grapple with the doll's inexplicable movements and its increasingly disturbing influence.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"The Dressmaker's Doll\" is a unique and atmospheric story, stepping away from the typical murder mystery to explore themes of the uncanny, fear of the unknown, and psychological unease.  The doll itself is the central mystery, its unexplained movements and silent presence creating a creeping sense of dread.  The setting of a dressmaking salon, usually associated with creativity and elegance, becomes imbued with a sense of the unsettling and the macabre.  The story focuses on the psychological impact of the doll on the characters, particularly Sybil and Miss Coombe.  Their initial bewilderment gradually transforms into fear and a feeling of being haunted or possessed by the doll's presence.  The doll's movements are subtle and gradual, adding to the sense of unease.  It is never explicitly stated that the doll is moving on its own, leaving room for interpretation, suggesting the possibility of psychological projection or a shared delusion among the women.\n\nThe reactions of the characters are crucial to the story's atmosphere. Mrs. Groves, the cleaner, is the first to express outright fear, articulating the doll's \"creepy\" and \"unnatural\" presence.  Sybil, initially more rational, becomes increasingly disturbed and preoccupied by the doll, her rational explanations failing to dispel the growing sense of unease.  Miss Coombe, the owner, initially amused, eventually succumbs to the unsettling atmosphere, becoming increasingly forgetful and anxious.  The story explores the power of suggestion and the way fear can amplify seemingly insignificant events.  The doll becomes a focal point for their anxieties, its silent presence acting as a catalyst for their growing unease and paranoia.  The attempt to dispose of the doll by throwing it out the window is a moment of dramatic action, but ultimately futile.  The doll's return, in the arms of a small child who claims to love it, offers a somewhat ambiguous resolution.  The child's words, \"She wants to be loved,\" suggest a possible interpretation of the doll's movements not as malevolent, but as a desperate plea for attention or affection, transforming the creepy and malicious presence into something more poignant and perhaps even tragic. The story ends on an unresolved note, leaving the reader to ponder the true nature of the doll's presence and the psychological impact of the unexplained and the uncanny.  It is a story less about solving a crime and more about exploring the darker corners of the human psyche and the unsettling power of the inanimate to evoke profound fear and unease.\n\n*8\ufe0f\u20e3 *In A Glass Darkly: Visions of the Future?* \ud83d\udd2e*\n\n_Summary:_  The story is narrated in the first person by an unnamed man who recounts a chilling experience from his youth.  In the summer of 1914, while visiting his friend Neil Carslake at Badgeworthy, he has a disturbing vision reflected in his dressing-room mirror.  He sees a girl with golden hair being strangled by a man with a scar.  Later that evening, he meets Neil's sister, Sylvia, the spitting image of the girl in his vision, and her fianc\u00e9, Charles Crawley, who bears the distinctive scar.  Haunted by the premonition, the narrator grapples with whether to intervene, fearing he may seem foolish or disrupt Sylvia's happiness, yet driven by a sense of impending tragedy.  He eventually confides in Sylvia, setting in motion a chain of events that profoundly alters the course of their lives and raises questions about fate, free will, and the nature of prophetic visions.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"In A Glass Darkly\" is a deeply personal and introspective story, focusing on the narrator's inner turmoil and moral dilemma rather than a traditional whodunit.  The story explores themes of premonition, fate, jealousy, and self-destruction.  The opening vision in the mirror is vivid and chilling, establishing a sense of impending doom.  The narrator's immediate recognition of Sylvia and Charles in real life as the figures from his vision creates a powerful sense of unease and inevitability.  His internal conflict is central to the narrative. He is torn between his rational skepticism and the compelling force of his vision, between his desire to protect Sylvia and his fear of appearing ridiculous or interfering in her life.  His growing love for Sylvia further complicates his dilemma, adding a layer of personal stake and emotional intensity.\n\nThe narrator's confession to Sylvia and her surprising reaction \u2013 belief and gratitude \u2013 marks a turning point in the story.  Sylvia's strength and pragmatism contrast with the narrator's initial hesitation and fear.  The outbreak of World War I provides a historical backdrop, overshadowing personal concerns with the larger tragedy of global conflict.  The war also acts as a catalyst for change in the narrator's life, forcing him to confront his feelings for Sylvia and his own mortality.  The death of Charles Crawley in the war removes one obstacle, but the narrator's deep-seated jealousy becomes the primary antagonist in his and Sylvia's relationship.  His jealousy, fueled by insecurity and possessiveness, gradually erodes Sylvia's love and drives her away.  The climax of the story is a dramatic confrontation where the narrator, consumed by jealousy, almost reenacts his vision, attempting to strangle Sylvia.  The mirror image of himself strangling Sylvia, mirroring his initial vision, acts as a moment of self-recognition and a turning point.\n\nThis near-fatal act of violence ironically becomes a catalyst for healing and reconciliation.  It forces the narrator to confront his inner demons and allows Sylvia to understand the depth of his torment.  The story concludes with a somewhat ambiguous resolution.  While the narrator and Sylvia ultimately find happiness together, the question of whether the initial vision was a genuine premonition or a psychological projection remains unanswered.  The narrator reflects on the \"what ifs,\" pondering how different their lives might have been had he acted differently or interpreted his vision another way.  \"In A Glass Darkly\" is a powerful exploration of human psychology, the destructive nature of jealousy, and the enduring mystery of fate and free will, presented through the lens of a chilling and unforgettable vision in a mirror.\n\n*9\ufe0f\u20e3 *Greenshaw\u2019s Folly:  Family Secrets and Fatal Inheritance* \ud83c\udff0*\n\n_Summary:_ Raymond West, seeking entertainment for his literary critic guest Horace Bindler, takes him to Greenshaw's Folly, a bizarre and imposing mansion.  They meet the eccentric owner, Miss Katherine Greenshaw, who, in a surprising turn, asks them to witness her will, leaving her estate to her housekeeper, Mrs. Cresswell.  Soon after, Miss Greenshaw is murdered with an arrow in her garden.  The police investigation focuses on three suspects: Mrs. Cresswell, the housekeeper and apparent beneficiary; Nat Fletcher, Miss Greenshaw's nephew; and Alfred Pollock, the gardener.  However, each suspect has a seemingly solid alibi.  Miss Marple, through Raymond's account and subsequent investigation, unravels a complex web of family secrets, hidden identities, and a cleverly orchestrated murder plot driven by greed and inheritance.\n\n_Elaboration:_ \"Greenshaw's Folly\" is a classic country house mystery, steeped in family history and hidden motives, set against the backdrop of an extravagantly bizarre mansion.  Greenshaw's Folly itself becomes a character, its architectural monstrosity mirroring the tangled and distorted relationships within the Greenshaw family.  Miss Greenshaw is portrayed as an eccentric and somewhat miserly old woman, adding to the story's quirky charm.  The initial setup, with the witnessing of the will and the apparent beneficiary being the housekeeper, immediately establishes a potential motive for murder.  The murder itself, with an arrow, is dramatic and unusual, adding a layer of theatricality to the crime.  The three suspects \u2013 the housekeeper, the nephew, and the gardener \u2013 each with seemingly airtight alibis, create a classic \"impossible crime\" scenario.  Inspector Welch, the investigating officer, is initially baffled, highlighting the complexity of the puzzle.\n\nMiss Marple, relying on Raymond and Lou's accounts and her own keen observation, begins to piece together the truth.  Her deduction hinges on the idea of misdirection and the staging of events.  She questions the timing of the murder, suggesting that Lou was deliberately placed in the library to act as a witness to a fabricated timeline.  Miss Marple's \"village parallels\" come into play as she connects Miss Greenshaw's eccentricities to the behavior of Mr. Naysmith, a local character known for his practical jokes and misleading impressions.  This leads her to suspect that Miss Greenshaw's will and her pronouncements about leaving everything to Mrs. Cresswell were themselves a deception, a \"strange jest\" intended to mislead.  The realization that Miss Greenshaw was likely drugged and replaced by Mrs. Cresswell in disguise before the \"murder\" is key to unlocking the mystery.  The \"policeman\" who arrives at the scene is revealed to be Nat Fletcher in disguise, his \"alibi\" carefully constructed to divert suspicion.\n\nThe motive is revealed to be inheritance and family secrets.  Alfred Pollock, the gardener, is revealed to be the illegitimate great-grandson of Nathaniel Greenshaw, making him the true heir.  Mrs. Cresswell and Nat Fletcher, revealed to be mother and son and not related to the Greenshaws, conspired to murder Miss Greenshaw and frame Alfred, believing they could inherit the estate by eliminating both the apparent beneficiary (Mrs. Cresswell herself) and the most likely heir (Alfred).  The archery club membership and Alfred's skill with a bow and arrow were deliberately intended to frame him for the crime.  Miss Marple's visit to Greenshaw's Folly and her observation of the poorly weeded rockery confirms her theory, revealing that the \"Miss Greenshaw\" working in the garden was not the real Miss Greenshaw, but Mrs. Cresswell in disguise, lacking the true Miss Greenshaw's gardening knowledge.  The story concludes with the exposure of the mother-son murder plot, thwarted by Miss Marple's astute deductions, revealing the dark secrets hidden within the walls of Greenshaw's Folly and the lengths to which people will go for greed and inheritance, proving that even in the most bizarre and eccentric settings, human nature and its darker impulses remain constant.\n\nThis expanded document should provide you with a very detailed understanding of each story in \"Miss Marple's Final Cases.\" Let me know if you need further elaboration on any specific point!"
