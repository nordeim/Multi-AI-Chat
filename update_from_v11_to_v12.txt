Okay, so I've updated the ModernChatWindow class for you! 🎉 The main change is in the _attach_file method. Here's the WhatsApp-style breakdown:

Bye-bye Redundant File Dialog! 👋 In the old _attach_file, you were calling QFileDialog.getOpenFileName() again even though the ChatSessionManager's attach_file already does that! 🤦‍♀️ We got rid of that extra file dialog in ModernChatWindow._attach_file. Now, there's just one file dialog, handled by ChatSessionManager.attach_file, which is much cleaner! 😌

Calling ChatSessionManager.attach_file() Correctly! ✅ The new _attach_file in ModernChatWindow simply calls self.session_manager.attach_file(). That's it! 👍 This triggers the file attachment process in ChatSessionManager, which includes:

Showing the file dialog for the user to select a file. 📂

Doing file size checks. 📏

Detecting if it's a text file. 📰

Creating those <attach-text> or <attach-binary> tags. 🏷️

Adding the attached file info to your chat session data. 💾

Crucially, it now returns some info back to ModernChatWindow – specifically, the file_name and file_path of the attached file. 🚀

Handling the Returned File Info! 📦 The ChatSessionManager.attach_file() now returns a tuple (file_name, file_path) if a file was successfully attached. The ModernChatWindow._attach_file now checks if it got this info back (if file_info:). If yes, it unpacks the file_name and file_path from the tuple. This file_path is then used to start the content processing in _process_file_content(file_path). 🎉

Still Processing File Content After Attachment! 🚀 After the file is attached (handled by ChatSessionManager.attach_file), you still need to process the content of the file (like extracting text from a PDF, or getting an image description from LLaVA). That's what the _process_file_content(file_path) part is for, and we've kept that in ModernChatWindow._attach_file. This part starts a new thread (FileProcessingThread) to handle the content processing in the background, so your UI doesn't freeze! ❄️

In short: We made ModernChatWindow._attach_file much simpler and smarter! 😎 It now correctly uses the attach_file method from ChatSessionManager to handle the initial file attachment steps, and then it proceeds to process the file content and update the UI, all in a cleaner and more organized way! ✨
