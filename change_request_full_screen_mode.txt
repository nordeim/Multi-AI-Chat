The user wants to add a full-screen mode toggle to the chat application. This mode should:

Make the chat display area occupy the entire application window.

Temporarily hide the left panel (chat list), file preview area, and input area.

Provide a way to toggle back to the normal, current layout.

Be implemented as a menu option in the navigation bar.

Aim for a quick and safe implementation with minimal disruption to existing code.

Evaluation of Implementation Options:

Direct Widget Visibility Control:

Mechanism: Use QWidget.setVisible(False) and QWidget.setVisible(True) to hide and show the left panel, preview area, and input panel. Resize the chat_display to fill the window in full-screen mode.

Pros: Simple, direct, and likely quick to implement. Minimal code changes.

Cons: Might require manual resizing of the chat_display to ensure it fills the space correctly. Need to manage the original sizes and layouts to restore them when toggling back.

Suitability: Good for a quick and relatively safe fix.

Layout Management with QStackedLayout or QGridLayout:

Mechanism: Use QStackedLayout to switch between two layouts: normal layout and full-screen layout. Or, use QGridLayout and dynamically change row/column spans and visibility of widgets.

Pros: More structured and potentially cleaner layout management, especially for complex UI changes.

Cons: More complex to implement initially than direct visibility control. Might involve restructuring parts of the UI setup. Possibly overkill for this specific feature which is relatively simple.

Suitability: Potentially more robust for very complex layout changes, but might be too much for this feature. Might be slower to implement as a "quick fix."

Using QMainWindow.showFullScreen() and QMainWindow.showNormal():

Mechanism: Use Qt's built-in full-screen functionality for the entire main window. Then, within the full-screen window, manage the visibility of the left pane, preview, and input area.

Pros: Leverages Qt's built-in full-screen handling. Potentially cleaner for making the whole window full-screen.

Cons: Might be slightly more complex to combine with hiding/showing specific panes within the full-screen window. Might affect the menu bar behavior in full-screen mode (depending on the OS and Qt version). Might not be ideal if we only want the chat display area to be full-screen within the normal window frame, and not the entire application window to be OS-level full screen.

Suitability: Could be good if we want true OS-level full-screen for the entire application, but might be less suitable if we just want to maximize the chat display area within the app's window frame.

Recommendation for Optimal Solution (Quick and Safe Fix):

Option 1 (Direct Widget Visibility Control) seems to be the most optimal for a quick, safe, and minimally disruptive implementation. It's straightforward to understand and implement, and should achieve the desired effect with minimal code changes. We can manage the visibility of the left panel, preview, and input areas directly and resize the chat display to fill the space.

Steps for Implementation (Option 1):

Add a "Toggle Full Screen Chat" Menu Item: Add a new QAction to the "View" menu (or "File" or "View" menu - "View" seems more appropriate) in _setup_menubar(). Connect its triggered signal to a new method, e.g., _toggle_fullscreen_chat().

Implement _toggle_fullscreen_chat(): This method will:

Keep track of the current state (normal or full-screen chat). Use a boolean flag, e.g., self.is_fullscreen_chat_mode. Initialize it to False.

If currently in normal mode (not full-screen chat):

Store the original sizes and visibility states of the left panel, preview area, and input panel.

Set the left panel, preview area, and input panel to setVisible(False).

Set self.is_fullscreen_chat_mode = True.

Potentially adjust layout weights or sizes if needed to make chat_display expand. (Initially, try without explicit resizing, Qt layouts might handle it automatically).

If currently in full-screen chat mode:

Restore the original visibility states of the left panel, preview area, and input panel using the stored values.

Set self.is_fullscreen_chat_mode = False.

Restore original layout weights or sizes if adjusted in full-screen mode.

Let's generate the code block for this implementation.
